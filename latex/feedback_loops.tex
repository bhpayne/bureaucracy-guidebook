\subsection{Feedback loops}

When there is a lack of feedback from customers/users, then someone has to decide.


when there are multiple competing objectives among different stakeholders in a zero sum use of resources, how to determine what's best? Typically there are feedback loops to guide progress. When feedback loops are weak or not present, then the most powerful stakeholder (which is distinct from the biggest or loudest) will dominate. 

Example of no feedback loop:
when there is a benefit to a small group and the cost is to a larger group



Suppose I earn \$100,000 and the tax rate is 30\%. Then my tax money sent to the government is \$30,000.

"In 2021, the [US] government collected \$4.05 trillion in revenue."
\footnote{source: Government Revenue | U.S. Treasury Data Lab}

My taxes of \$30,000 is
30000/4050000000000 = 0.00000074\%

When I do not maximize the effectiveness of \$1,000,000 of government money, of that misallocated money \$0.0074, or about one penny, was taxes I paid. The feedback loop is weak.

Federal pay is limited to about \$220,000\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive\_Schedule}, so that raises the feedback to 2 pennies.

The lack of feedback allows waste to go unfelt. There's no immediate consequence.
Waste is indistinguishable from not enough funding or insufficient skills

Bob parks his car in a parking garage every day. The parking garage owner charges \$20 per day for people to park their car.

Bob recently found that one of the exit gates for the parking garage is broken. If Bob uses that gate to leave the parking garage, the gate does not function and Bob cannot exit. Then Bob has to call the parking gate operator to request an exception (which is granted) and Bob can then exit that gate, avoiding the \$20/day charge.

This action (go to broken gate, request exception, avoid charge) has been repeated for a long time (months). Bob's motive is to avoid the \$20 parking charge; the cost is a mere phone call and a minor delay. This cheating behavior harms the parking garage owner's income. However, the parking gate operator, serving as intermediary, insulates the parking garage owner from the interaction with the cheater. The cheating behavior is small enough that the parking garage owner may not notice.
