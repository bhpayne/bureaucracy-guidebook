\subsection{What does Bureaucracy imply?}
Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to politics, or any specific institution (corporations, governments, academics). Bureaucracy is not defined to be efficient nor, does it have to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not restricted to paperwork, or record keeping, or quantification, or gathering metrics. 

Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision making, coordination, and processes. Involves negotiation, primarily informal. In that context, wouldn't it be useful to be skilled at bureaucracy?
