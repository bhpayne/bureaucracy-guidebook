\section{Fundamentals of Bureaucracy\label{fundamentals_of_b}}
  
Bureaucracy as a system of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. The intent is to manage shared resources. The decision making is not purely logical; it relies on particular facets of human interaction. This section outlines the critical roles of decision making, hierarchy, and communication in bureaucracy.

Decision making (\S\ref{sec:decision-making}) is central to bureaucracy. Every other aspect of bureaucracy derives from decision making. The decision making is with respect to the subjective management of resources. 

When there are multiple people present, or even when one person is trying to be self-consistent, coordination of decision making is important to the management of resources. While coordination can occur without hierarchy when there are a small number of people, typically an organization of people leads to both formal and informal hierarchies. Who gets to make which decision is managed using hierarchy; see \S\ref{sec:hierarchy_of_roles}.

Meetings and written communication help with consensus among bureaucrats, though agreement isn't necessarily the outcome.
Once a decision is made, the choice selected by a person propagates throughout the organization to achieve some level of consistency. See \S\ref{sec:meetings-for-coordination} on meetings and \S\ref{sec:written-communication} on written communication.

If you're not an academic researcher of bureaucracy, you might be thinking that you don't want to have to think about hierarchy or collaboration or coordination. Meetings and email are not your goal; you just want to do the tasks that you were trained for. Your formal education process had individual grading. You perceive your job as a bureaucrat as having pay, promotion, hiring/firing, and title that  seem focused on your individual abilities. The following sections explain why the individualist mentality is ineffective when you are part of a  system of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making.
