\subsection{Static and Dynamic Process}

change is expected. What's the point of establishing static processes that are not robust to change?
So you can point to an effort and you don't look totally neglectful.

How to establish processes that are dynamic?
1) Document business logic; this is fragile to change.
2) enumerate assumptions used in the logic
3) relate the assumptions to a cost/benefit model
4) establish measurements that inform the cost/benefit model.

Then when change happens the variables of the cost/benefit get updated by measurement, the cost/benefit model alters the assumptions. Therefore the business logic needs to be updated.
