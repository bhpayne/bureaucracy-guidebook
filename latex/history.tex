\section{History of Bureaucracy}

After making two points in this area, I'm going to skip the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy#History}{history of bureaucracy}.  % and merely cite other scholarly references in this section

First, bureaucracy has repeatedly arisen independently in a variety of cultures lasting for timescales that exceed the lifespan of one person. That indicates the current situation is not a fluke or coincidence. There is some utility (or pathology) that is consistently recurring. 


Second, bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans! Subjective policy enforcement in support of an organization arises in pre-human tribes, visible in groups of modern apes.
