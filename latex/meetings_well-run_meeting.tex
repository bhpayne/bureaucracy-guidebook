\subsection{Well-run meeting\label{well-run_meeting}}

Identify essential attendees. If someone does not need to be present, notify them in advance that you will share the meeting notes afterwards. 


\textit{Bad}: no meeting agenda\\
\textit{Good}: Have an agenda. \\
\textit{Better}: \underline{Share the agenda with other participants}. Having an agenda keeps attendees focused.  Enables tracking of progress during the meeting so participants are more likely to get to all topics.
\textit{Best}: For formal meetings, \underline{share agenda in writing prior to meeting}. Sharing the agenda in advance allows attendees to prepare.

Forces conspiring against agendas: takes time to create an agenda. Attendees might not take the time to read beforehand. Attendees may not stick to the agenda during the meeting.


For formal in-person meetings, Verify meeting venue has sufficient space, seating, working IT equipment

For formal virtual meetings, ensure participants are familiar with virtual meeting controls

\subsubsection{Meeting facilitator skills}

To run a smooth and productive meeting, I explicitly state two ground rules to the attendees:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If you want to talk, raise your hand and I will call on you. If there are multiple people wanting to talk, I'll track the order of speakers.
    \item If you talk too long, I'll cut you off. 
\end{itemize}
This approach is critical when there are many people present, when people with diverse backgrounds are present, or when there is a mixture of dominant and submissive personalities present. 
If a visual signal like hand raising is not used, reliance on verbal interruption defaults to dominant personalities. Waiting for a person to finish speaking doesn't work for everyone because some participants will use more than their fair share of time. speaking for a long time needs to be addressed regardless of whether an intentional effort to exclude others or a consequence of verbosity.

As a facilitator, my focus is on structure (distinct phases of the discussion) and ensuring participation. I remove myself from taking part in the discussion.

\subsubsection{Asking dumb questions without feeling Intimidated}

Asking a question of an expert from a position of ignorance can feel intimidating. You may worry you're wasting the expert's time. In a recurring meeting a facilitator can address this by having participants write questions on paper and submitting anonymously. The questions or discussion topics can then be raised at subsequent meetings. 

To facilitate the anonymity every participant must be given paper and pen, and every participant must write something on the paper. The facilitator then has to collect the paper from each participant. For contributors who don't have a question, they can write down feedback about the meeting. 

This technique allows the expert to get the information needed for a response, or to figure out who the best person to respond is.
