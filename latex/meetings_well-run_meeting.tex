\subsection{Well-run meeting\label{well-run_meeting}}

Identify essential attendees. If someone does not need to be present, notify them in advance that you will share the meeting notes afterwards. 


Bad: no meeting agenda\\
Good: agenda\\
Better: agenda share with other participants
For formal meetings, share agenda in writing prior to meeting.

\subsubsection{Meeting facilitator skills}

To run a smooth and productive meeting, I explicitly state two ground rules to the attendees:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If you want to talk, raise your hand and I will call on you. If there are multiple people wanting to talk, I'll track the order of speakers.
    \item If you talk too long, I'll cut you off. 
\end{itemize}

As a facilitator, my focus is on structure (distinct phases of the discussion) and ensuring participation. I remove myself from taking part in the discussion.
