A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an organization than by working alone. Being a member of an organization means the bureaucrat's identity is subsumed into service for the organization they are part of~\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation}{Deindividuation}}. At the same time, bureaucracy enables the bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being part of a larger organization.  Sometimes the cost of being part of the organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.
