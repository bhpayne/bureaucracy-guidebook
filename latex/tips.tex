\subsection{Tips for working in an organization}

Be prepared with a backlog of ideas if someone shows up with resources

When you are asked to take on additional work. Avoid responding with ``that's not my job." If the request is misguided and your perception is that is really is the responsibility of another person, ask if the requester is aware of that other person's responsibilities. If you are to really take on the work, get guidance on re-prioritizing and make sure the request is documented in writing. 

Presence creates priority

If there's something you want to accomplish, strive for influence without authority instead of working to gain control over resources (e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following: ``In this organization X is important to me, but I can't do X right now because I don't have enough power in the org. So I'll get promoted and then do X."


Bad: no meeting agenda\\
Good: agenda\\
Better: agenda share with other participants
