\subsection{Tips for working as a bureaucrat in an organization}

Superpowers of a bureaucrat in a bureaucratic organization that facilitate cooperation and progress:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-tasking, or, more accurately, task switching. The switch among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an externally-generated pause. 
    \item Be prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone shows up with resources.
    \item If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to enable your progress, \underline{presence creates priority}.
    \item Quickly replying to incoming requests. This allows other people's tasks to either be resolved or have a clear response about when progress can be expected. 
    \item Avoid unintentionally dropping tasks or requests. This requires capturing incoming requests and then providing a response about prioritization and status. This matters because other participants in the organization should regard you as reliable in a positive sense. 
\end{itemize}

Bureaucracy induces emotional response in participants because things don't work they way each person wants. This can lead emotionally to frustration and then apathy. Understanding how things operate in a bureaucracy decreases the anger.

Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of powerlessness.

That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to subjects of bureaucracy.

When you are asked to take on additional work, avoid responding with ``that's not my job." If the request is misguided and your perception is that is really is the responsibility of another person, ask if the requester is aware of that other person's responsibilities. If you are to really take on the work, get guidance on re-prioritizing and make sure the request is documented in writing.

If there's something you want to accomplish, strive for influence without authority instead of working to gain control over resources (e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following: ``In this organization X is important to me, but I can't do X right now because I don't have enough power in the org. So I'll get promoted and then do X."
