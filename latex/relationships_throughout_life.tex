\section{Relationships throughout life}
In the conventional Western progression, relationships include
\begin{itemize}
    \item pre-education childhood: primarily family, possible community members, caretakers
    \item primary education: family, friends, teachers
    \item college, graduate school: friends, teachers, advisors
    \item employment: managers above you, peer employees, people you manage
    \item healthcare
\end{itemize}

\subsection{school vs business}
School (high school, undergraduate, graduate school) is  different from working in a large organization. 


\subsection{undergrad vs graduate}
 education process roles and expectations vary over time

\subsection{military}
Less than 0.5\% of the United States population serves in the military. \footnote{source: \href{https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/demographics-us-military}{Council on Foreign Relations}}

The military, with rigid hierarchy and defined protocols, is also a distinct experience.
