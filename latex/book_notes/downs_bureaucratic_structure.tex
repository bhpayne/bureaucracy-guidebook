\cite{1966_Downs}

Intended audience:

author has read this book: no\\
author has a copy: yes, electronic\\
author's assessment:

The customer of an organization is not who consumes the product (i.e., report readers).

Instead, the survival of a bureau is dependent on its ability to ``demonstrate that its services are worthwhile to some group with influence over sufficient resources to keep it alive."
