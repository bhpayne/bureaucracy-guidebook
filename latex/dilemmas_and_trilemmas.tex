When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that presents a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma}{dilemma}. The name for the case with three viable options is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma}{trilemma}. 

% claim
Dilemmas explain the inherent complexity of bureaucracy even when bureaucrats are honest and the purpose of the organization is clear.
% relevance
The point isn't that one should select one of the two options. The point of a dilemma is that it is a marker that there is a decision to be made.
% consequence
The action for the bureaucrat in response to this assessment is to talk with fellow bureaucrats about these dilemmas. Rather than seeking consensus, strive for comprehension of other people's perspective. That way you can navigate processes more effectively.

\subsection{How Dilemmas arise in bureaucracy}

Given a task, the simplest response for an individual is to take action and be done. 

If the task is more challenging, it may be necessary to first make a plan, then take action and be done. The source of the challenge may be task complexity, scale, number of people impacted, diversity of stakeholders, amount of time needed, how the current task shapes future decisions, number of collaborators, etc. Regardless of why the task is challenging, a dilemma has already arisen: how much time to spend planning versus doing. 

If the task is even more challenging, it may be useful to gather data for the plan, then make a plan, then take action and be done. A new dilemma arises: how much time to spend gathering data versus planning. The previous dilemma still exists -- planning versus doing. As an alternative to the dilemma framing, how much time should be allocated to three categories of activity?

But wait, how did the person in the first scenario (just do the task) know no plan was necessary? Either it was an explicit choice or they didn't perceive the need to decide about whether to plan. Someone else faced with that same task might choose differently, e.g., to make a plan. The task complexity is relative to the person's skills, experiences, and expectations about stakeholders and ramifications.

In this escalating sequence of increasingly challenging tasks, suppose the task involves you and another person. The overhead of coordination inflicts additional dilemmas. 

An independent source of friction is when people involved in the task don't agree on how challenging it is. The framing of the difficulty matters because it alters how much time is left for carrying out the action. 

The choice of ``how complicated is the task?'' shapes the team dynamics and hierarchical roles. 

\subsection{Folk wisdom on decision making in the face of dilemmas}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick\%27s_law}{Hick's law}\marginpar{[Tag] Folk wisdom}: ``increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically.''

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon\%27s_razor}{Hanlon's razor}\marginpar{[Tag] Folk wisdom}: ``never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.''

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson\%27s_law}{Parkinson's law}\marginpar{[Tag] Folk wisdom}: ``work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.''

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy\%27s_law}{Murphy's law}\marginpar{[Tag] Folk wisdom}: ``Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.''

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality}{Law of Triviality}\marginpar{[Tag] Folk wisdom}: ``people within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.''


\subsection{Dilemmas are a poor framing}

Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways to simplify situations into a dilemma are
\begin{itemize}
    \item start with a single variable, e.g., "how much data gathering", and force it into a binary choice "more data gathering" versus "less data gathering"
    
    % a reduction of a complicated situation to one variable. 
    \item start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and reduce it to a false dichotomy of zero-sum options: "more data gathering" vs "more planning." The actual trade-space involves optimization of multiple objectives, like (maximize productivity) and (minimize risk) and (maximize quality) and (maximize employee satisfaction) and (minimize latency). 
    % https://bennorthrop.com/Essays/2022/code-ownership-stewardship-or-free-for-all.php
\end{itemize}
These over-simplifications neglect both the continuous nature of the trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a specific situation. 

\subsection{Dilemmas as a framing to ease you into the complexity}
The choices are described here in simplified representation as a starting point intended to introduce the decision space relevant to individual bureaucrats. Awareness of these dilemmas and trilemmas are intended to spark creative imagination about the nuances specific to your situation.

Do not accept the dilemmas presented here as the final framing. Thinking in terms of a limited spectrum of opportunities neglects nuances that enable more creative approaches. Ponder theses dilemmas prior to the pressure of real-time decision making.  Recognize dilemmas and trilemmas and then avoid them by adapting to the local conditions and specific people available to help.

\subsection{Dilemmas are not purely intellectual}
Decision making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for the decision maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and any compromise will be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh on deciders.

\subsection{Additional complications}
Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here are occur concurrently and continuously. The dilemmas are inter-dependent due to both to the common variables and the constrained resources.
Selecting an option for one dilemma alters the options available in other dilemmas.

Oscillation between approaches can be caused by change of management, accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one solution, the desire for promotion (change as progress), desire for cost savings. The rate of oscillation is an indicator of the half-life of institutional memory. 


\subsection{Personal Policies}

In practice, the following decisions are unordered and are constantly faced by the bureaucrat. As observed in \cite{1959_Lindblom}, this flurry of decisions contrasts to a regularized process that might be envisioned as optimal.

The logistics of gathering data can be measured, but there are other subjective aspects to account for as well. Making a decision has an emotional toll on the decider due to the risk of failure. Also, decisions are made in a social context, with decision makers accounting for the ramifications on people they have relationships with. 


Gathering data (Dilemma~\ref{table:gather_data_lots-vs-little}) is distinct from planning (Dilemma~\ref{table:planning}). It is possible to do a lot of planning with only a little information gathered, and it is feasible to have lots of data and do no planning.

\end{center}

Making a decision imposes a bound on how much time is available for both gathering data and planning. Time is zero sum, so more time gathering data is less time planning. Similarly, the number of people available for data gathering and planning is bounded, and tasking people is a zero sum choice.

Practically, gathering data and planning never terminate, they evolve 




When planning (Dilemma~\ref{table:planning}), aspects to consider include

Once data is gathered (Dilemma~\ref{table:gather_data_lots-vs-little}) and a plan is made (Dilemma~\ref{table:planning}), the result is disseminated. The choice on how to disseminate is Dilemma~\ref{table:consistency} and Dilemma~\ref{table:disseminate_one-by-one}.

Centralization is often carried out for the purposes of cost efficiency. The cost savings are due to de-duplication and having less slack. Both of those ``savings'' are a decrease of redundancy, which has a cost when there are unexpected fluctuations in need. 

Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with the corresponding decrease in choices. 

Centralization (de-localization) can decrease the value assigned to feedback from people using the service because personal relations are de-valued. 

The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on relationships motivates the creation of local services.

Goldilocks situation for amount of processes:
* too few processes (all social relationships)
* just the right amount -- a balance process and social, and when to use which is known.
* too much process (not enough leveraging of social relationships)
Similar to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve}{Laffer curve} in economics.

Trilemma: \textbf{Do you work for your team, your manager, or yourself?}
Being a member of a team that operates within a hierarchy is tough. One reason is the question of who you are working for. The trilemma is whether you work for yourself, work for your supervisor, or work for your team.  Ideally you can find ways to do all three, but that is not always the case. 

Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy -- they are accountable to the boss.

In the approach ``team members are directed by their supervisor," the synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck (for decision making and for creativity and for planning).

The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers. 

\ \\

Trilemma:
Seek less budget, same, or larger budget 

\ \\

A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are \textbf{fast, inexpensive, good; choose two}. (This is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle}{Project management triangle}.) \\
In other words, the options are
\begin{itemize}
    \item good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of resources)
    \item good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., a clever solution)
    \item fast and inexpensive will be low quality
\end{itemize}

\ \\

There are many of dilemmas. Even if everyone considers the same choices (which doesn't necessarily happen), not everyone makes the same selection. Is the right response to defer to someone higher in the hierarchy to coordinate? While this would ensure consistency, this would be micromanagement. The people in the hierarchy above the person facing the choice don't have exposure to the problem.


Three ``so what" for dilemmas/trilemmas:
1) construct pareto frontier to identify non-optimal choices that can be eliminated
2) instead of assess variables in isolation, assess in workflows
3) raise subjective decisions to explicit discussion with stakeholders so that disagreement can be negotiated .
