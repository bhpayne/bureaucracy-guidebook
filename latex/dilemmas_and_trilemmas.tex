\section{Dilemmas and Trilemmas\label{sec:dilemma_trilemma}}

A simple decision is one that has one good choice and one or more bad choices. The work is to identify which is the good choice and select that option.

A complex decision may have many choices, and there are might not be a best option. Then a Pareto frontier might exist where trade-offs can be made. 

When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that presents a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma}{dilemma}. The name for the case with three viable options is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma}{trilemma}.

Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for the decision maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and any compromise will be suboptimal. 

The following are presented as dilemmas, but that oversimplifies both the continuous nature of the trade-off and the alternative creative approaches to a specific situation. The reason to be aware of these dilemmas to be able to ponder them prior to the pressure of real-time decision making. 

The dilemmas are all happening at the same time and all the time, and they are inter-dependent. Making a choice for one dilemma shapes the options available in other dilemmas.

These dilemmas are presented in no particular order.

Being a member of a team that operates within a hierarchy is tough. One reason is the question of who you are working for. The trilemma is whether you work for yourself, work for your supervisor, or work for your team.  Ideally you can find ways to do all three, but that is not always the case. 

Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy -- they are accountable to the boss.

In the approach "team members are directed by their supervisor," the synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck (for decision making and for creativity and for planning).

The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers. 

\ \\

A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are \textbf{fast, inexpensive, good; choose two}. (This is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle}{Project management triangle}.) \\
In other words, the options are
\begin{itemize}
    \item good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of resources)
    \item good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., a clever solution)
    \item fast and inexpensive will be low quality
\end{itemize}
