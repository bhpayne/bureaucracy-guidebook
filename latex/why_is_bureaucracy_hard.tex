\subsection{Why is bureaucracy so hard?}

When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy, positive attribution is made to the people involved. Or ease of a solution makes the bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems obvious. 

When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints are about the incompetence of the people involved, or the incomprehensibleness of the system. Don't these bureaucrats know how to do their job? Why isn't the solution obvious? Why does this system not work for me?

many nuances not visible to external perspective
\begin{itemize}
    \item organization politics (personalities, resources, prioritization)
\item lack of unified voice
\item legacy policies to overcome/change/be consistent with
\end{itemize}
