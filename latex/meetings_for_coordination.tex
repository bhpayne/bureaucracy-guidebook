\subsection{Meetings for coordination\label{sec:meetings-for-coordination}}
In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are a necessary artifact for facilitating coordination. The coordination accomplished by a meeting can be explicit (verbal or written), or it can be indirect through signaling (who attended the meeting, when the meeting was held, where the meeting was held, how much notice was provided). 

Meetings are a vital aspect of coordination in a bureaucracy. Tips are in \S~\ref{well-run_meeting}.

\textit{No plan; I just do what you tell me.}\\
Employee: I just do what you tell me to do. With that approach, either I will be successful because I worked hard on what you directed, or I will fail because I was directed to do the wrong thing by you.\\
Manager: Is that how you want your career to go? I think you're smart, and I think you're capable of shaping your career.

\ \\

\textit{No point in making a plan}\\
Employee: There is no point in making a plan, because everything changes so frequently.\\
Manager: But the software has an end goal, right?\\

Employee: Yes, so then the plan is to get from where we are now to that end goal.\\
Manager: And there are no intermediary steps? Milestones?

Manager: Is it better to have no plans and just put up fires reactively, or to have a plan that is subject to change?

\ \\

\textit{What is a plan anyways?}\\
Manager: I think there is value in creating a goal, enumerating tasks that would support the goal, identifying the dependencies among the sub-tasks, and time-binning the dependencies with defined milestones and deliverables. That is my definition of a plan. And having that is more useful than merely reacting.

\ \\

\textit{Who's plan?}\\
Employee: I don't need to come up with that plan, you already have a plan. Just tell me what the plan is.\\

Manager: That's not as effective as coming up with independent plans and then resolving the differences. There's value in resolving the differences, Even though that will cost time and frustration and displace time to implement.
