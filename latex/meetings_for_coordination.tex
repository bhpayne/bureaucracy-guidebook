\subsection{Meetings for coordination\label{sec:meetings-for-coordination}}
In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are a necessary artifact for facilitating coordination. The coordination accomplished by a meeting can be explicit (verbal or written), or it can be indirect through signaling (who attended the meeting, when the meeting was held, where the meeting was held, how much notice was provided). 

Meetings are a vital aspect of coordination in a bureaucracy. Tips are in \S~\ref{well-run_meeting}.
