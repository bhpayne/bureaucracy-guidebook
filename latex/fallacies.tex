\section{Bureaucratic Fallacies\label{sec:fallacies}}

There are perspectives that are \gls{thought terminating}. Identifying these enables you to understand both why they are attractive and how they are incomplete.

See also unavoidable hazards in section~\ref{sec:unavoidable_hazards}.

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic fallacy}: \textbf{Bureaucracy is bad}. \\
\index{fallacy!bureaucracy is bad}
\textit{Why this feels true}: when a person subjected to bureaucracy has a negative experience, the easiest attribution is to the least-understood aspect -- the bureaucracy.\\
\textit{What this is missing}: \Gls{bureaucracy} is neither good nor bad. 

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic fallacy}: 
\textbf{There is no point in planning ahead since everything (staffing, funding, purpose, scope) is always changing.}\\
\index{fallacy!no point in planning}
\textit{Why this feels true}: Change can feel disorienting, especially when it is unexpected. \\
\textit{What this is missing}: Preparing for change and thinking ahead about contingencies enables effective use of resources. Have a vision and work towards it while accounting for change. 


\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic fallacy}: \textbf{Bureaucracy is an aberration, a mistake, due to poor planning or incompetent participants}. \\
\index{fallacy!bureaucracy is a mistake}
\textit{Why this feels true}: Mistakes are made, poor or insufficient planning does happen, and some participants are incompetent.\\
\textit{What this is missing}: Bureaucracy occurs even if no mistakes are made, effort is spent on effective planning, and participants are competent. That's because bureaucracy is the use of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making, and bureaucrats face dilemmas (see section~\ref{sec:dilemma_trilemma}).

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic fallacy}: \textbf{Bureaucracy is inefficient}. \\
\index{fallacy!bureaucracy is inefficient}
\textit{Why this feels true}: Expressed by both subjects and bureaucrats who observe seemingly wasteful processes.\\
\textit{What this is missing}: If bureaucracy were truly inefficient (not allocating resources in the most efficient way), then it would be replaced by a more efficient approach. The key is to ask, ``efficient with respect to what metric?'' The metric of money, time, number of people, stability, robustness to perturbation.  Second, what would motivate improved efficiency? Without incentives, change is less likely. 

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic fallacy}: \textbf{Bureaucracy is due to malfeasance.}\\
The specific number of malicious bureaucrats ranges from ``all of the participants'' to ``just enough to be problematic.'' \\
\textit{Why this feels true}: There are bad actors. 
\textit{What this is missing}: Bureaucracy is unavoidable, and most of the participants are earnestly trying to help or are not making a positive contribution. Processes within bureaucracy are used to deal with malicious bureaucrats, like isolation or promotion. 

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic fallacy}: \textbf{Bureaucracy is a sign of decay from within the org.} \\
\textit{Why this feels true}: Relationships within an organization have a half-life and require on-going investment in renewal. At the same time new bureaucratic processes are constantly being developed by other bureaucrats and increase as the organization ages. Bureaucracy seems to arise without effort and countering it takes effort.  \\
\textit{What this is missing}: Bureaucracy is unavoidable emergence in any/every organization, but the negative connotation of decay should be replaced with a sense of (neutral) evolution.

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{If this request can't be expedited, it must not be important}.  \\
\textit{Why this feels true}: Other people would demonstrate they care about what I am working on by prioritizing things I am dependent on.
\textit{What this is missing}: When everything gets prioritized, that's the same as nothing getting priority.

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{Duration of a task is how long it would take one person to accomplish}.  \\
\textit{Why this feels true}: When I imagine carrying out a task, the default is a story with one character. \\
\textit{What this is missing}: Fails to account for the overhead of interaction and delays due to asynchronous engagement.

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{Consider the average or majority (to the exclusion of outliers)}. \\
Why this simplification is misleading: For sufficiently large ensembles, the outliers alter the outcome. The larger the ensemble, the more significant the role of the outlier minority.

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{People learn from their mistakes}. \\
\textit{Why this feels true}: People repeat mistakes. People do not reflect on their failings. \\
\textit{What this is missing}: People \textit{can} learn from their mistakes. Requires a low latency feedback loop and incentive to change.

\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{Processes are serial}.\\
\textit{Why this feels true}: A conventional approach to process design is a sequence of tasks. As an example, approval chains. \\
\textit{What this is missing}: Some tasks that are independent can be carried out concurrently; see section~\ref{sec:reducing_overhead} for details.


\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{Hard work creates results}.\\
\textit{Why this feels true}: Some results do require hard work. \\
\textit{What this is missing}: Hard work can be invested on wasteful effort. Don't confuse being busy with being productive.

%\ \\

% NOT USEFUL
%\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: \textbf{Motivations for bureaucrats are categorized as individualistic, tribal, organizational, societal, or humanity}.\\



\ \\

\textit{Bureaucratic Fallacy}: 
\textbf{You cannot pay a little and get a lot}; see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law_of_business_balance}{Common law of business balance}. \\
\textit{Why this feels true}: If small investments made a big difference we'd already be making the investment.\\
\textit{What this is missing}: This doesn't account for creative solutions and ignores \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory}{nudge theory} from behavioral economics.
