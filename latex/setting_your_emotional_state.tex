\subsection{Setting Your Emotional State}

As a member of a bureaucratic organization, you may feel frustrated by the bureaucracy, the happiness of success, excited by possibilities, or the fear of uncertainty of operating in a complicated environment. Your emotional state, whether set by your work or set by events outside the bureaucracy, impacts your productivity and the well-being of your coworkers. 

You may see emotions as getting in the way of productivity and creating problems, or emotions as unprofessional. This view is not shared by everyone, and there are real benefits to concepts like passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and joy. Yes, joy can be felt by bureaucrats.
