\subsection{Failure to communicate}

%How does communication among individuals fail?

In practice, communication takes times and skill; not everyone is willing to invest in communication that is seen as not ``doing the work". Additionally, accounting for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen\_curve}{Allen curve} takes effort. The time needed to arrive through consensus at an optimal approach for a given situation may exceed time available for solving the problem.
 
 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve}{Allen curve}\marginpar{[Tag] Folk wisdom}: ``exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the distance between them increases.''

Weekly activity reports push good news up the chain and obfuscate the nuanced risk analysis. 
Leadership decisions are not pushed down the chain.

Role of assumptions 


There are ``levels of enlightenment":
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I feel bad
    \item I can't do what I want
    \item I can't do what I want in the way I want
    \item There is a problem
    \item I have a solution
    \item I have an implementation
    \item I tried but my solution didn't work
    \item Life sucks but I get a pay check
    \item I quit (in hopes of being more successful somewhere else)
\end{enumerate}
