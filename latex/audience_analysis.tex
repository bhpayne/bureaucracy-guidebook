\section{Audience Analysis}

Primary audience for this book is self-identified novice bureaucrats and people planning to work in a bureaucracy. Value of this book is advice beyond ``be a good person'' and specific to the role of a bureaucrat (and not project manager/team lead/software developer). 

Secondary audience is white collar workers who have experience working in a bureaucracy and are just realizing they are bureaucrats. This audience will find some of the information to be already known.  The value for this audience is a re-framing of the environment and problems. 

Tertiary audience is non-bureaucrats who want to better understand why bureaucratic systems are challenging. Americans consider themselves "individuals" and neglect the necessary integration of operating within a society. This book won't be a popular best seller, but it is intended for a lay audience and does not assume prior academic exposure to the topic.

Lastly, researchers of bureaucracy. This book is not a theoretical systemic analysis.
