% Claim: you already have habits; these are similar to processes use by bureaucrats in organizations

Individual habits are routines that you apply to ease the burden of decision making. 

Habit can be intentional (my policy is to brush my teeth before going to bed) or unconscious (arriving at work without recalling driving there). 

An intentional habit for an individual motivated by a personal policy is akin to processes applied by bureaucrats acting on behalf of an organization.
