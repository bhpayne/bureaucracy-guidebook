\subsection{Hierarchy of roles}

An \gls{organization} often (though not always) has a defined set of roles, and those roles have different amount of decision authority. 

Roles are defined by boundary of responsibilities. Purpose is to minimize conflict and reduce redundancy, allowing regularity and control. Clear responsibility. 


Independent of roles and titles in the hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a separate social hierarchy of informal influencers and decision makers. Influencers in a burocracy have long relationships with the decision maker or relevant credentials or both. The credentials can be formal (e.g., a PhD) or informal (demonstrated success on a project). In either case, the decision maker is relying on expertise. 

Another set of informal relations is mentors and mentees. These relations allow mentors to transmit institutional knowledge to mentees, and allows people in senior positions to access the novice perspective. 


Options when seeking a decision
\begin{itemize}
    \item wait for approval
    \item ask forgiveness (often viewed in contrast to seeking approval)
    \item solicit opposition
\end{itemize}
