\subsection{Deployment of Processes, aka policy update}

Design processes to prevent bad people from joining the process, detect them when they are in the process, and remove them when they do not change their behavior. Simultaneously, enable and detect good ideas and promote them and give them resources.
Promote efficiency, have enough justification so that something goes wrong there's a clear track of why without burdening too much documentation.

When designing a process, look for ways to minimize the impact on the people involved. Minimizing work (both physical and mental) for the people involved means less sensitivity to entropy in a bureaucracy. Minimizing work requires significant situational awareness on the part of the designer. In order to minimize impact on existing bureaucracy, it's vital to minimize the requirements to achieve success.


Similar to product deployment in that similar dilemmas are faced

Deployment of processes and products need to account for 
normal users, Power users, malicious users, and edge cases

\subsubsection{Internal product development and deployment\label{sec:internal_product}}

Teams in a bureaucratic organization 
\begin{itemize}
    \item consume from outside-the-organization
    \item consume from within-the-organization
    \item produce to outside-the-organization
    \item produce to within-the-organization
\end{itemize}

This section focuses on the relation between teams that produce to within-the-organization and teams that consume from within-the-organization. Tools or products that are created internally and consumed internally.

Feedback mechanisms and incentives in a non-profit monopoly. The claim of success that a team created a product that met all design requirements on-time may have no actual benefit to users. Or maybe a product that benefited internal customers was created and there were happy users, but the originating team has to quickly move onto the next project to create another success and thus has no attention to on-going support. Determining the metric of success is tricky. do you want to aim for highest average happiness of stakeholders, or are some more important?
