\subsubsection{Why written communication does not happen\label{sec:written-comm-does-not-happen}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item too many reports/emails/memos/messages to read and process and respond to. Emotionally overwhelmed.
\item the person may read slowly
\item the person may type slowly, or their hand writing is poor
\item fear of imperfect communication. What if the email is incomplete or inaccurate or ambiguous?
\item the person views written communication as ``official" or ``plan of record'' and does not feel comfortable brainstorming or creating contingency plans
\item the person wants to avoid accountability for their statements
\item the person may not be confident in their writing ablity -- spelling, grammar, sentence composition, structuring content. \footnote{For tips on writing, see
