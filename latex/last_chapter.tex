It is possible to operate within a bureaucracy and entirely focus on ``just do the job.'' It is also possible to do your job and understand the role of engaging with other people -- peer bureaucrats, supervisors, and subjects. In this book a third option of accounting for emergent phenomena has been argued for. 

Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn't mean you can ignore personalities of individuals. Bureaucracy as a skill is in addition to being a good person, being an effective member of a team, being a good project manager, having technical skills, etc.
