\section{Models of Bureaucracy}

Coming up with a holistic theory of bureaucracy is desirable but difficult. Bureaucracy exists in every society, so having an explanatory theory would help identify what is critical and what is not essential. Having a theory of bureaucracy could help identify what should be improved and what should be discarded. An expectation for the existence of a theory stems from the repeated independent creation in diverse societies in different time periods. 

Characterizing bureaucracy is difficult because organizations comprised of unique humans are aware of attempts to be characterized and respond to stories told about bureaucracy; see the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect}{Hawthorne effect}. As soon as a claim about bureaucracy-as-a-concept is made, then a individual people can respond to that claim by behaving in an opposing manner. 

In the following section I outline a few ways of modeling bureaucracy for the purpose of pointing out the shortcomings of each model. The relevance to the practicing bureaucrat of familiarity with these models is so that you know why the boundaries of each model. Awareness of the limitations of each model enables you to know when the model is an applicable story and when the model is not explanatory. 

\subsection{Bureaucracy as a Machine}

\textit{Narrative}: Bureaucracy is a machine that has throughput and latency and dependencies and mechanisms. Bureaucrats are cogs in that machine.\\
\textit{Why this feels true}: Bureaucracy can be complicated and feel mechanical with standardization, top-down dictates, and interlocking processes. There is a risk of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation}{deindividuation} for bureaucrats. \\
\textit{What this is missing}: Perceiving yourself as a cog in the wheel implies a loss of agency. This is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy}{self-fulfilling prophecy} -- if you think you don't have agency, then you stop having agency.

\subsection{Bureaucracy as an Economic model}

\textit{Narrative}: A Bureaucracy is a Collection of Rational actors. \\
% https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2019/05/cooperation-and-competition.html
Individual bureaucrats cooperate or compete to promote their own self-interests.
The culture of an organization is a result of individual self-interests of each bureaucrat.
Individuals cheat, lie, or break social norms to promote their own self-interests.

This view is hard for me to distinguish from a marketplace.

\textit{Narrative}: A Bureaucracy as a subcategory of a Firm. \\
% https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2017/09/market-friction-and-bureaucratic.html
Firms exist in a market because negotiating contracts and prices for every interaction is burdensome. 
% https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/hubbard/htm/research/ec174/lectures/3coase.htm
A bureaucracy could be considered as a type of firm that specializes at the organizational level in policy administration or resource management. 

%Doesn't address small vs large companies, and doesn't distinguish between profit-oriented and non-profit and government. 


\subsection{Bureaucracy as Emergent phenomenon}

There is a universality to bureaucracy in both the diversity of scenarios and persistence across time that hints at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence}{emergence}. Bureaucracy as a macroscopic phenomenon is emergent at when there are a sufficient number of people. The size of the organization is important because there is no longer dependence on individual relationships (beyond \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar\%27s_number}{Dunbar's number}). There are people in the organization that you don't know and for which there is no personal accountability. An organization subdivided into team recursively until there is local person-to-person accountability.  The underlying behaviors that enable emergence are bilateral interactions among humans and a lack of feedback mechanisms. 

At the scale of individual bureaucrats, every person is playing by different rules and has different objectives and everything is changing -- both the individuals and the conditions. 
Above the threshold for emergence of bureaucracy there is scale-free behavior. The same patterns are observable at large organizations and extremely large organizations. A bureaucrat in one organization recognizes patterns of professional life experienced by bureaucrats at another organization. The local mechanisms bureaucrats employ to enable distributed decisions using distributed knowledge include meetings, processes, and communications. 

The choices faced by an individual bureaucrat are not independent of the choices made by other bureaucrats in their environment. There is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)}{flocking behavior} of my choices are informed by the choices of those around me. Unlike flocking of birds, the adjacency metric for bureaucrats is not necessarily spatial distance.


The relevance of claiming bureaucracy is emergent is that there is behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale; knowing that individual motives and actions of every player at the microscopic level is not relevant.


A colloquial interpretation of emergent behavior from complex phenomena is treating the system as an entity -- personification.\marginpar{[Tag] Fallacy} When an organization is assigned behaviors (\cite{2002_Gall}), it is useful to remember that the organization is comprised of bureaucrats.

More formally, there are distinct categories of emergence \cite{2002_Bedau}. Nominal emergence names the phenomena of a thing being distinct from its constituents: a circle is emergent from a collection of points; a pile of sand emerges from grains of sand. Merely putting many bureaucrats in a room is insufficient to create bureaucracy; there are additional aspects necessary to bureaucracy. 

Weak emergence occurs when there are phenomena that are independent of the underlying interactions. For example, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway\%27s_Life)}{gliders} in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway\%27s_Game_of_Life}{Conway's Game of Life}.
Weak emergence is measurable using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality}{Granger causality} or, equivalently\footnote{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4514}{https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4514}}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy}{transfer entropy} (information theory). I don't know how to apply these measures to bureaucratic organizations. 

\textit{What this model is missing}: The problem with treating an organization as an entity is that apparent behavior is counter-intuitive. Breaking the organization into individual people with motives helps clarify the cause of the behavior. 
%This merely improve the post hoc rationalization. 

In practice, bureaucracy is worse than emergent because the rules can be altered or ignored by the stakeholders. Bureaucracy is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem}{wicked problem} which resists mathematical models. 

\subsection{Bureaucracy in Game Theory}
Bureaucracy does not fit cleanly into the game theory categories of being either cooperative or competitive -- in practice there are elements of both. 

% not relevant: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game}{coordination game}

Maybe all the interactions within a bureaucracy are a bunch of small games?

Bureaucracy is self-modifying. 

Bureaucracy is in constant flux due to external conditions, externally imposed constraints, staff turn-over, internal dilemmas, disagreements of individuals.

\textit{What this model is missing}: History of the processes (legacy) and protection against malicious subjects and protection against malicious bureaucrats. 


\subsection{Bureaucracy as Psychological Phenomenon}

\textit{Narrative}: Bureaucracy as a pure power struggle. Or playing out the interplay of individual psychosis. \\

Are you doing what's best for you, the group you're in, or everyone?
Altruistic or reciprocal? Retaliation
The answer changes time the time and situation of situation and person to person

Just a mixture of pathologies?

Perception: Organizations are composed of individuals with personalities, and the inefficiency is attributable to a mashing together of distinct individuals with conflicting desires.
While this is true, it isn't complete. \\
\textit{What this model is missing}: Other aspects like history of the processes (legacy) and protection against malicious subjects and protection against malicious bureaucrats. Analysis that stops at personalities misses emergent phenomena. Analysis that stops at personalities of individuals typically explains larger scale phenomena using personification of teams and organizations.

Each of the above models has shortcomings. Knowing why each model is not a complete description helps you avoid the trap of thinking only in terms of a single model. 

The rest of this book ignores these partial characterizations of bureaucracy. 
Rather than take the external (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic}{emic}) view of bureaucracy, this book takes the internal (etic) perspective of a bureaucrat operating within an organization. 
The description of bureaucracy in this book is to contextualize the advice for how to be an effective bureaucrat.
