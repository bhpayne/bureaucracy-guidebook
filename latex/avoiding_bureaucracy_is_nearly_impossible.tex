\section{Avoiding bureaucracy is nearly impossible}

The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live completely on your own, with no interaction with other people. That means completely disengaging with society. 

For the rest of us, bureaucracy is necessary for our rights. We prove our name using paper, we claim our citizenship using paper, and those papers are used by other to validate our claims. That's a subjective policy that stakeholders agree to. 

Even the libertarian view of contract enforcement implies some about of bureaucracy. Not all bureaucracy is from the state.
