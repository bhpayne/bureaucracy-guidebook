\section{Communication within a Bureaucracy}

In this book I don't address paper memos versus email versus phone calls versus video chat versus Skype versus Slack. 
The relevant attributes are agnostic to specific technologies and implementations: synchronous versus asynchronous; discoverable or not discoverable; searchable or not searchable. 
%In that context, there might be some interesting bureaucratic specific things to think about.

Communication within a bureaucratic organization occurs on a gradient of how official the information is. Examples of the gradient ordered from unofficial to official:
\begin{itemize}
    \item I just made this up and I have no authority
    \item Based on my experience, ...
    \item Based on my training, ...
    \item I heard from someone else (folklore from a peer)
    \item I heard from someone in a position of authority
    \item Referencing a written document
    \item Referencing a written document that looks official
    \item Referencing a written document that looks official with the signature of a position of authority
\end{itemize}
These indicators convey the relative importance of information for the bureaucrat.

Information within a bureaucracy shapes the relationships of bureaucrats. That spans from not sharing information (which can harm or protect relationships) to being transparent to being vulnerable.  
Being transparent conveys ``here's what is happening." Being vulnerable expands that to ``here's why that's happening or what might happen."
