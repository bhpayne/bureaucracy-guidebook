\subsection{Who is a bureaucrat?}

A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The ``policy'' might simply be ``take money from customer in exchange for items and gas,'' but the subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of room for the cashier to shape the customer's experience. Does the cashier greet the customer when the customer enters the store? Does the cashier look at the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How quickly does the cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances that are left to the cashier in the execution of the store policy means there is room for subjective application of the policy. 

This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, grocery clerks, retail clerks. Teachers, police, tax collectors, and other state works are government bureaucrats.

Factory line workers subjectively apply policies. Enforcement of quality standards is the most obvious area. Pacing of work is a negotiation.

Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow bureaucrats. In this scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a policy to other bureaucrats. 

Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters, both to the employee and to the business. The risk of not self-identifying as a bureaucrat is that you won't grasp how much control you have in implementing and enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly follow rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and you will harm the business/institution you are applying the rules for. Adapting policies to circumstances is the value of having judgement capacity. 

In a similar sense from the consumer/citizen perspective, if you don't think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won't perceive the opportunity to negotiate.  If you view rules as fixed and inflexible, you will harm your ability to make progress. If a rule was made by a human, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces the rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a modification or an exception?
