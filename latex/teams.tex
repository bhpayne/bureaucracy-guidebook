\subsection{Teams are Subdivisions of an Organization}

\cite{2015_Katzenbach}

In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team. 


For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige, products (output).

\subsubsection{Roles of Management versus Leadership}

Teams include managers and leaders. Those roles are not necessarily the same person. 

A manager's role involves time management, task tracking, employee evaluations, promotion, pay, requesting resources for team members, and hiring. 

A leader's role focuses on coordinating vision and principles. The vision and principles do not have to originate from the leader -- other team members can contribute ideas. The leader's responsibility is primarily social consensus.
