\subsection{Building, Managing, and Spending Reputation\label{sec:reputation}}

Bureaucrats want to be all things to all people. Limiting your scope means disappointing some people. The team you are on may have a limited scope, but that is constrained only by the creative negotiation with other teams in the organization. Teams compete for budget, staffing, and glory. The budget and staffing are finite investments for improving reputation.

Reputation matters for influence. How other people perceive you impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek out your help or input.

Your reputation is actively changing based on your activities and communication -- both your communication and the stories others tell about you.

Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to the stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation requires engaging people and generating evidence. 

Reputation is set whenever and where ever you are observed, or artifacts are associated with you. What you wear, when you show up, how your emails appear, body posture in meetings. 


Reputation is perception of the person the bureaucrat is engaging with.  What does that person think of you?

Ideally that would be a function of their technical skill, ability to collaborate with other people, the strength of their network, creativity. None of this matters if the person you're engaging with doesn't know those things. 

Based on your reputation, what trust does that person have? 

To spend reputation is to bend the rules. 

Spending reputation means taking risk that involve other people

Build reputation by doing useful things that are visible to other people



Rather than tell good news directly to a top decision maker, I first inform the person who influences the decision maker. I tell the influencer the information does not need to be credited to me.
Benefits:
* improves the influencer's reputation with the decision maker
* influencer has the chance to contextualize the information for the decision maker
* influencer has the option to leverage the information in ways I would not have
* my reputation with the influencer is enhanced
* I reaffirmed the influencer's role and status
* Influencers are easier to access
