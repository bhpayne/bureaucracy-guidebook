Reputation matters for influence. How other people perceive you impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek out your help or input.

Your reputation is actively changing based on your activities and communication -- both your communication and the stories others tell about you.

Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to the stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation requires engaging people and generating evidence. 

Reputation is set whenever and where ever you are observed, or artifacts are associated with you. What you wear, when you show up, how your emails appear, body posture in meetings.
