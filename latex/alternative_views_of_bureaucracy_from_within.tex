\subsection{Views of bureaucracy within a bureaucratic organization\label{sec:alternative_views_from_within}}

Bureaucracy as I have defined it in \S\ref{sec:define_bureaucracy} is not the only way that bureaucrats perceive their environment. 

Bureaucrats typically focus on themselves, their work, their subjects, their coworkers, their superiors, and their subordinates. In that context, the motives for activities varies.  If your request costs me additional work and there's no deadline and there's no reward, what is my incentive? Emotional approval? Relationship building? social approval?

The perspectives below are archetypical for bureaucrats who don't consider bureaucracy as defined in \S\ref{sec:define_bureaucracy}; an individual's perspective might be a mixture of these views.

\ \\

\textbf{As a bureaucrat, what matters is what I can accomplish with my skills and the resources I have access to.} \\
\textit{Assessment}: This person is task oriented. Results are what matters. The intricacies of bureaucracy are a distraction to getting the work done.

Communication as a distraction from work of the individual. 
May have the perception that if they initiate formation of a community, they will be blamed when things go wrong.
The emotional reward for this person is accomplishment of the task. This person is likely to say to their manager, "Tell me what I need to do to be successful" rather than identify collaborations.

\ \\

\textbf{As a bureaucrat, what matters is how I feel.} \\
\textit{Assessment}: Your feelings are real. They have consequence, in that your emotions impact motivation and enthusiasm. However, a feelings-centric perspective may not be productive for you or your team or the organization. Balancing those competing needs is challenging.

\ \\ 

\textbf{What matters is how others feel.}\\
Depending on the emotional state of those around you is unhealthy and can be unproductive. Working for the happiness or satisfaction of other people is risky -- they may not know what's best, or they may not have your interests in mind.

\ \\

\textbf{What matters is my immediate coworkers.}\\
In this scenario everything else is personified or ignored. This can be positive (I collaborate with those around me) or negative (I am in competition with those around me). \\
\textit{Assessment}: Your do relationships matter. However, they are not all that matters. Being able to explain what is happening outside the immediately observable realm is what is missing from this view. 



Just because you are a bureaucrat doesn't mean you have a well-informed understanding of bureaucracy. 

A bureaucrat my explain to themselves why things don't work in an org:
* other people are lazy / don't want to work
* other people are inexperienced
* other people don't care
