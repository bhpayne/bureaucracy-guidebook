\subsection{What to Read\label{sec:to_read}}

The content of this book is independent of the specific role you as a bureaucrat will be playing. I assume you are striving to be a good person, and that you have relevant education/experience for the position in the organization.

The reading lists

\href{https://github.com/pdfernhout/High-Performance-Organizations-Reading-List}{High Performance Organizations}, and 
\href{https://github.com/ankitjaininfo/awesome-managers}{Managers}
are outside the scope of a guidebook for bureaucracy. 
%Bureaucracy involves hierarchy, so understanding the mechanics and nuances of hierarchical roles is useful. 


%Books on management might not seem applicable if you are not already in a management role.
Reading management books is helpful regardless of whether you are a manager, want to become a manager, or if you never want to become a manager. In all three cases, gaining awareness of best practices and alternative approaches benefits you as a bureaucrat and the people you coordinate with -- bosses, peer bureaucrats, subordinates, and subjects.
