\subsection{Processes and Mistakes}

Mistakes can originate from the bureaucrat, in the hand off, or from the subject.

Imposing sanity checks meant to reduce mistakes create more bureaucracy 


As a process participant, I may cause a mistake or observe a mistake. 
I can 
* ignore it
* fix it -- extra work
* report it
    * anonymously. Decreases harm to my reputation, but eliminates feedback
    * with my name so that discussion can occur and I get feedback
