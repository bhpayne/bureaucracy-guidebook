\subsection{Processes and Mistakes}

Mistakes can originate from the bureaucrat, in the hand off, or from the subject.

Imposing sanity checks meant to reduce mistakes create more bureaucracy 


As a process participant, I may cause a mistake or observe a mistake. I can 
* ignore it
* fix it -- extra work
* report it
    * anonymously. Decreases harm to my reputation, but eliminates feedback
    * with my name so that discussion can occur and I get feedback
    
    
    

why fixes fail:
* path from person with problem to person who can address the situation may pass through many people. 
The consequence is familiar to people who have played "telephone game"
Person with problem explains the problem to the helpdesk staff member. helpdesk staff member hears the problem with incomplete context and from their own frame, then relays it to their maanger, who talks to the manager of the engineering team, who delegates the responsibility tot he engineer. 
This is a solvable problem, in that the engineer can talk with the customer.
