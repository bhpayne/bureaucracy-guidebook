\subsection{Leveraging Expertise\label{sec:expertise}}

Expertise is a resource administered by the bureaucracy.

Don't measure things otherwise you'll be held accountable for them.

In this section two viewpoints are described: that of an expert providing help, and that of a bureaucrat seeking expert help. 


\subsubsection{For experts looking to help non-expert decision makers}


Non-experts think and speak less precisely

You, the expert, may not win any debates based on number of years of experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However, expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from. 

Identify which party (you, the expert, or the audience) has broader diversity of situations.

respect and account for the expertise of the audience (especially when they work in a different field). Acknowledge your own limits.

Don't rely completely on expertise as a single dimensional relation. Find ways to relate personally to audience members. They will need to build trust in you personally.

Facilitate the audience setting the goals. They should be able to identify how success is defined.

Identify strengths your audience has and build on those.

You don't have to teach a group all-at-once. One-on-one teaching is more customizable, and the audience may feel less worried about asking dumb questions.

Once you've taught more than one person, they can help each other translate the skill. 

\subsubsection{For non-experts looking for expertise}

Experts may lack experience communicating their knowledge. 

Experts are cautious to include caveats and limitations

Translation process is necessary from "here's what's known in general" + "situation specific facts" to "plan of (in)action" and what's realistic with what confidence. 

Experts straying outside their expertise are dangerous because the boundary may not be clear to the audience.



How to recruit an advisor if you don't have expertise yourself: triangulate. Seek guidance from your existing social network. Advisor should be opinionated (not meek) but adaptive to new information.
