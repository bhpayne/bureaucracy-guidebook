<p>Thank you to my coworkers who taught me how to be a better
bureaucrat.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy,
the attribution is to the people involved or the obviousness of the
solution.</p>
<p>I wrote this book for a younger version of me. I was sufficiently
self-aware when I first started my job in a large organization to
recognize I didn’t know much about working in that environment. School
(high school, undergraduate, graduate school) are very different from
large organizations. The military, with rigid hierarchy and defined
protocols, is also a distinct experience. Over the years I learned from
my mistakes by reflecting on my (in)actions and the consequences. This
approach has been an expensive education: mistakes delay progress and
damage relationships.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about bureaucracies, or you
are thinking about working as a bureaucrat, or you are employed as a
bureaucrat, or your job is shifting to be more bureaucratic. If you
don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, or if the term bureaucrat has
negative connotations, I hope to change your mind on this vital
topic.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to decrease surprise and arm you (both
emotionally and intellectually) for the toil of being a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>This book does not have a narrow focus on one topic like leadership,
managing a team, being a team member, planning, time management, project
management, advancing your career, or self-improvement. Some lessons may
apply in those domains.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex professional environments, both within
your career and outside of work. The perspectives offered in this book
can benefit you directly, whether by promotion of title or increase in
pay; successful completion of a project; or through decreased stress of
understanding how the world works.</p>
<p>There’s harm in not recognizing yourself as a bureaucrat, as the role
and responsibilities are distinct</p>
<p>Automation and computers will not eliminate or decrease bureaucracy.
They merely obfuscate the processes and make negotiation more
challenging.</p>
<p>Simplifying to "this interaction is characterized merely as human
relations" is an easier perspective. However, that misses emergent
phenomena.</p>
<p>There’s a risk of overanalysis. Sometimes a pipe is just a pipe.
Avoiding conjecture about conspiracy and malice is a difficult boundary
when insufficient information is available.</p>
<p>I recognized the importance of navigating bureaucracy early in my
career, but the insights were most clear when I entered middle
management.</p>
<p>My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the
observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint
hard.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research or policy development. While this material is intended to be
timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the USA. As a
privileged white male, I did not encounter systemic hurdles in my career
so there are blindspots not addressed in this book.</p>
<p>This material is based on personal experience, reading published
materials, and anecdotes from other people. No surveys were taken to
support the claims made. No double blind experiments were conducted.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is feasible. Each section is intended
to be stand-alone. The book is intended to spark contemplation.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-bureaucracy">Introduction to Bureaucracy</h1>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is bureaucracy?</h3>
<p>While you may know it when you see it or experience it, for this book
a definition is useful. <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the subjective
implementation of policies to facilitate coordination of
stakeholders.</p>
<p>This concept is most visible for complex, long lasting, and recurring
situations involving many people. The apparent friction can be lower
when there are only a few people involved (“I’m just talking to my
collaborator" or “I’m just buying groceries from a clerk” or “I’m using
a website for a government service.”), but there is a continuous
gradient.</p>
<p>Effectively, bureaucracy enables you to rely on other people by
enabling other people.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-bureaucracy-imply">What does Bureaucracy imply?</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, or any specific institution (corporations, governments,
academics). Bureaucracy is not defined to be efficient nor, does it have
to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not restricted to paperwork, or record
keeping, or quantification, or gathering metrics.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision
making, coordination, and processes. Involves negotiation, primarily
informal. In that context, wouldn’t it be useful to be skilled at
bureaucracy?</p>
<h3 id="why-does-bureaucracy-exist-cant-we-just-do-the-work">Why does
bureaucracy exist? Can’t we just do the work?</h3>
<p>how does bureaucracy come into existence? * complexity of problem</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism</p>
<p>The minimal scenario to start from is to imagine a single person
working on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is
relatively easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does
not recur. Most of what you do occurs outside those limits and thus
incurs some concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks where order of the subtasks
matters.</p>
<p>What if we completely avoided bureaucracy? Try replacing
“bureaucracy" in that question with “coordination of stakeholders". If
you avoid coordination of stakeholders, what you get is random
interactions.</p>
<p>What if we minimized bureaucracy? Again, try replacing “bureaucracy"
in that question with “coordination of stakeholders". The goal of
“minimizing coordination" probably isn’t the real objective. To be more
precise, a specific objective might be “minimize time spent executing
the task" (which takes a lot of coordination prior to the task
execution) or “minimize the level of distraction to stakeholders" (chunk
the coordination time). Another strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is
to reduce the number of stakeholders involved. For a given task
complexity, this means having smarter people who have more skills.</p>

<h3 id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of roles</h3>
<p>An <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span> often (though not
always) has a defined set of roles, and those roles have different
amount of decision authority.</p>
<p>Roles are defined by boundary of responsibilities. Purpose is to
minimize conflict and reduce redundancy, allowing regularity and
control. Clear responsibility.</p>
<p>Options when seeking a decision * wait for approval * ask forgiveness
(often viewed in contrast to seeking approval) * solicit opposition</p>

<h2 id="history-of-bureaucracy">History of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>I’m mostly going to skip history and merely cite other scholarly
references</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy</p>
<p>Bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans! Subjective
policy enforcement emerges in pre-human tribes, visible in groups of
modern apes.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<h3 id="scale">scale</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book primarily
focuses on the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization.
This might be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>) up to millions of people.</p>
<p>There are tens of companies that employ more than a million people
[see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers">Wikipedia’s
list of largest employers</a>], including Walmart, Amazon, and
McDonald’s.</p>
<p>Small companies and non-profit organization also encounter
bureaucracy. The complexity of the tasks may be different, but the same
scale-independent patterns can emerge because of a common factor: human
behavior.</p>
<h1 id="bureaucracy-throughout-life">Bureaucracy throughout life</h1>
<h2 id="avoiding-bureaucracy-is-nearly-impossible">avoiding bureaucracy
is nearly impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
completely on your own, with no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging with society.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, bureaucracy is necessary for our rights. We prove
our name using paper, we claim our citizenship using paper, and those
papers are used by other to validate our claims. That’s a subjective
policy that stakeholders agree to.</p>
<p>Even the libertarian view of contract enforcement implies some about
of bureaucracy. Not all bureaucracy is from the state.</p>

interaction</p>

<ul>
<li><p>pre-education childhood: primarily family, possible community
members, caretakers</p></li>
<li><p>primary education: family, friends, teachers</p></li>
<li><p>college, graduate school: friends, teachers, advisors</p></li>

<h2 id="org-chart-orientation">Org chart orientation <span
id="org-chart-orientation" label="org-chart-orientation"></span></h2>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the "org chart"). Normally the CEO is
at the top of the chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed
employees are at the bottom.</p>
<p>There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CEO at the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>CEO on the left</p></li>
<li><p>CEO on the right</p></li>
<li><p>CEO as the center of a star</p></li>

<h2 id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social and Bureaucratic
interactions</h2>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social interaction example: "Did you see the game on TV last
night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting tickets
for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucratic interaction example: "You’ll need to get approval
from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their review. Then
talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>To make invisible work and invisible bureaucracy visible, document
the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s "culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social/visible bureaucracy/invisible bureaucracy is a characterization
of the culture. There are norms associated with each of these three
categories. essential bureaucracy is the minimum necessary to address
the complexity of the problem space. This is tricky since the
optimization can be with respect to resilience to change, resilence to
edge cases, staff turn-over, speed experienced by consumer, financial
cost, organization time, organization staffing level.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is either accidental or legacy</p>
<h2 id="efficient-bureaucracy">Efficient Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no bureaucracy, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information. Then the management
process of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (money, staffing) and no need to fight over
direction.</p>
<p>While that ideal scenario is not going to happen, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each person has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>each person applies the same decision making process
consistently</p></li>
<li><p>every person has the same incentives</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is inefficient is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not everyone has the same information</p></li>
<li><p>processes are inconsistent</p></li>
<li><p>incentives vary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add the issue that each person’s reference experiences are
unique. As a consequence, decision making is subjective.</p>
<p>Can any action be taken to improve bureaucratic efficiency? Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you can share information with other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can seek information from other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can strive for and demonstrate transparency</p></li>
<li><p>apply consistent processes</p></li>
<li><p>hold others (and yourself) accountable</p></li>
<li><p>account for varying incentives and reference experiences</p></li>
</ul>
<p>motivations of participants are rarely "how can I make the company
more successful" or even "how can I sell/produce more product"? Usually
motivation is based on personal success in various manifestations, which
leads to emergent phenomena which appears confounding to observers
outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>career stability is a benefit, and it can be leveraged to take more
risk. However, it typically manifest as inaction by an employee. There’s
no harm to the employee in not taking action. If an employee doesn’t do
anything, nothing bad will happen to that employee. Career stability
decreases extrinsic motivation.</p>
<h2 id="processes-as-a-tax-on-productivity">Processes as a tax on
Productivity</h2>
<p>The Laffer curve is a claim in economics that there is a relation
between government tax rates and the revenue from taxes collected. The
relation, based on Rolle’s theorem, says that between a tax rate of
0</p>
<p>While the mathematical statement may be provable, the use in
economics seems hand-wavy. In this post, I’ll extend that hand-waviness
to a different domain: bureaucratic processes in organizations. The
relation to the Laffer curve is that bureaucratic processes a tax on
productivity.</p>
<h2 id="bureaucratic-fallacies">Bureaucratic fallacies</h2>
<p>Bureaucratic fallacy: product focused narrative. Example: school
house rock bill</p>
<p>Bureaucratic fallacy: system as an entity</p>
<p>Bureaucratic Fallacy: duration of a task is how long it would take
one person to accomplish</p>
<p>Bureaucratic Fallacy: people learn from their mistakes. Require a low
latency feedback loop and incentive to change</p>
<p>Bureaucratic Fallacy: processes are serial hire for metacognition,
social skills, and intrinsic motivation</p>
<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers
available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige,
products (output)</p>
