<p>Thank you to my coworkers who taught me how to be a better
bureaucrat.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, I hope to change your
mind on this essential topic. If the idea of bureaucracy has negative
connotations for you, I want to convince you that bureaucracy is useful
and that you can learn to skillfully navigate bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, or you are thinking about how to productively contribute to
society, or you want impactful employment, or your job is not what you
expected.</p>
<p>Everyone is a bureaucrat. The purpose of this book is to decrease the
surprise of that experience and better arm you emotionally and
intellectually for the toil of being a bureaucrat. With focused
reflection and a good guidebook, you can improve your skills as a
bureaucrat.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, or self-improvement. However, in the process of being a better
bureaucrat some lessons may apply in those domains.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex professional environments, both within
your career and outside of work. The perspectives offered in this book
can benefit you directly, whether by promotion of title, increase in
pay, successful completion of a project, or through decreased stress of
understanding how the world operates.</p>
<p>If you do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, you’re less likely
to be successful interacting with those around you. The self-recognition
of being a bureaucrat matters because the how you behave and what you
think your responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle in the face of
complex large-scale systems. By learning about bureaucracy, you increase
your ability to identify patterns and apply the relevant techniques.</p>
<p>There are no alternatives to bureaucracy, so gaining skills in
navigating bureaucracy are helpful.</p>
<p>Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is
not helpful. Automation and computers merely obfuscate processes and
make negotiation more challenging.</p>
<p>Simplifying interactions with other people to “this is characterized
merely as human relations" is an easier perspective compared to
considering bureaucracy and complex systems. However, a simplified view
either misses emergent phenomena or mischaracterizes the situation. In
either case, your effectiveness is harmed.</p>
<p>When I first started my job in a large organization to recognize I
didn’t know much about working in that environment. Over the years I
learned from my mistakes by reflecting on my (in)actions and the
consequences. This approach has been an expensive education. My mistakes
delay progress and damage relationships.</p>
<p>In my reflections and attempting to draw lessons there is a risk of
overanalysis. Sometimes a situation is merely happenstance, and
sometimes attempting to extract lessons from randomness is folly.
Avoiding conjecture about conspiracy and malice is a difficult boundary
when insufficient information is available.</p>
<p>My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the
observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint
hard.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research or policy development. While this material is intended to be
timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the USA. There are
cultural blindspots not addressed in this book because I did not
encounter systemic hurdles in my career as financially privileged white
male.</p>
<p>This material is based on personal experience, reading published
materials, and anecdotes from other people. No surveys were taken to
support the claims made. No double blind experiments were conducted.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is the default option. Chapter <a
href="#fundamentals_of_b" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fundamentals_of_b">[fundamentals_of_b]</a> defines the
essentials. Chapter <a href="#b_throughout_life"

independent of Chapter <a href="#b_made_of_humans"

in Chapter <a href="#b_made_of_humans" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="b_made_of_humans">[b_made_of_humans]</a> is intended to
be able to be read stand-alone. The content is intended to spark
contemplation.</p>

<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy<span
id="fundamentals_of_b" label="fundamentals_of_b"></span></h2>
<p>This section provides terminology and definition for a bureaucratic
lens. Specifically bureaucracy is defined and labels for roles in
bureaucracy are named. Structure in organizations is often characterized
by hierarchy, and that hierarchy is described by an “org chart.” Lastly,
meetings and written communication are described as the way in which
consensus among bureaucrats is established.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is bureaucracy?</h3>
<p>While you may know it when you see it or experience it, for this book
a definition is useful. <span data-acronym-label="Bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">Bureaucracy</span> is the subjective
interpretation of policies and discretionary enforcement/implementation
to facilitate coordination of stakeholders on behalf of an
organization.</p>
<p>Let’s break that down piece-by-piece. First, “subjective
interpretation” means there is a person making a decision about how to
do something. “Policies" is a set of actions for a given circumstance.
“Discretionary enforcement and implementation” means the person is
choosing how to apply the policy in the specific circumstances.
“Facilitating coordination” means bureaucracy is about getting multiple
people (or sometimes a person at different instances in time) to work
together. The “stakeholders” is a group of people who care about the
application of the action in each circumstance. Finally, “an <span
data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span>" is the
collection of people for who the policy is made. That’s still pretty
dense, so the rest of the book is spent expanding on the nuances and
implications of the definition.</p>
<p>Another way to think about bureaucracy is as a system for distributed
knowledge and distributed decision making. That is in contrast to
easier-to-understand concepts like centralized knowledge and centralized
decision making.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex, long lasting,
and recurring situations involving many people. The apparent friction
can be lower when there are only a few people involved (“I’m just
talking to my collaborator" or “I’m just buying groceries from a clerk
at the store” or “I’m using a website for a government service.”), but
there is a continuous gradient.</p>
<p>The protagonist in a bureaucracy is the <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> – the person
responsible for subjective implementation of someone else’s intent, with
unquantifiable results. In this book the person that a bureaucrat’s
decisions are inflicted on a <span data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. In various contexts,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a policeman or government
official. Sometimes a bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on other
bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policy for embassy employees.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of Roles</h3>
<p>A major feature of bureaucracy is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">structure
of the organization</a> for which policies are created and carried out.
Structure in an organization is dynamic, but at any point in time an
organization typically has a defined set of roles. Those roles have
different scopes of decision authority.</p>
<p>Roles in an organization are defined by the boundaries of
responsibility. The purpose of a role is to minimize conflict and reduce
redundancy, allowing regularity and control. Clear responsibility
enables effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The consequence of hierarchy in an organization means that as a
member of the bureaucracy you do not have full autonomy – otherwise you
would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time you are not
under strict control of the organization – you still have some
subjective decision making authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. Some autonomy is retained by all members of
the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Independent of defined roles and designated titles in an
organization’s hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a
separate social hierarchy of informal influencers and decision makers.
Informal influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships
with the decision maker or relevant credentials or both. The credentials
can be formal (e.g., a PhD) or informal (demonstrated success on a
project). In either case, the decision maker is relying on another
person’s expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relations within an organization is mentors
and mentees. These relations allow mentors to transmit institutional
knowledge to mentees, and allows people in senior positions to access
the novice perspective.</p>
<p> <br />
Within an organization’s hierarchy, a common task is consensus about
action. There are distinct options about how to get that consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval. Incurs both providing justification and
waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness. Often viewed as being in contrast to seeking
approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p> <br />
One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people because they think they are disempowered. A
person, Sue, is perceived to have power over another person, Amy,
because Amy gave up some control to Sue. Amy not having control creates
fear, regardless of how Sue behaves.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-chart-as-a-guide-and-a-lie">Organizational chart
as a guide and a lie</h3>
<p>An <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart">organizational
chart</a> (hereafter “org chart”) identifies roles and the relations
among roles. An org chart is at best a snapshot in time, and more often
aspirational than descriptive. In spite of possible deficiencies, an org
chart helps outsiders and newcomers understand the scope of
responsibilities and interactions.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Org charts are a lie in the sense that undocumented relationships can
matter more than the roles. Org charts fail to capture the informal
roles that facilitate progress in any organization.</p>
<p>Org charts foster a lie by creating sense power dynamics based on
visual orientation. For more on this issue see § <a
href="#org-chart-orientation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org-chart-orientation">[org-chart-orientation]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="meetings-for-coordination">Meetings for coordination</h3>
<p>In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are a
necessary artifact for facilitating coordination. The coordination can
be explicit, or it can be indirect through signaling.</p>
<p>Meetings are a vital aspect of coordination in a bureaucracy, so tips
are in § <a href="#well-run_meeting" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="well-run_meeting">[well-run_meeting]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="written-communication">Written Communication</h3>
<p>Reports, memos, emails are artifacts of bureaucracy in an
organization. A written record creates evidence about policies and
decisions. Existence of a record can be used for good or for harm.</p>
<h3 id="decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Decision making in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>There isn’t one answer, much less a correct answer. If there were,
there wouldn’t be a need for a decision. Even afterwards a decision can
be difficult to evaluate for correctness.</p>
<p>In bureaucratic processes there is rarely a formal assessment of
options. Decisions are rarely recorded.</p>
<p>Decision making by bureaucrats can be informal or formal,
consensus-based or solo.</p>
<p>Most decisions made by bureaucrats do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are trade-offs in timing. Sooner is better, but delaying
allows for more information gathering for a better informed
decision.</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat is going to rely on expert consultation, the decision
maker needs to be confident the expert is not of straying outside their
area of expertise. For example, I don’t rely on a botanist with many
published papers to tell me how to change the oil in my car.</p>
<p>When getting input for a decision, is the expert providing a factual
summary, a predictive assessment, or a value judgement?</p>
<p>There are many ways to gather evidence. Role of measurement and
modeling. Form an opinion, look for evidence to back the outcome.
Instead of measurement, most people rely on history (if they are aware
of it), or what is best for their career, or how to accumulate more
power, or what someone else says to do.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bureaucracy">History of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>I’m mostly going to skip history and merely cite other scholarly
references in this section</p>
<p>One interesting fact to ponder is the independent emergence of
bureaucracy in a variety of cultures lasting for timescales that exceed
the lifespan of one person.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy">Wikipedia:Bureaucracy</a></p>
<p>Bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans! Subjective
policy enforcement emerges in pre-human tribes, visible in groups of
modern apes.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-bureaucracy">Scope of bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a bureaucrat?</h3>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The “policy” might simply
be “take money from customer in exchange for items and gas,” but the
subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of room for the
cashier to shape the customer’s experience. Does the cashier greet the
customer when the customer enters the store? Does the cashier look at
the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How quickly does the
cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances that are left to the cashier
in the execution of the store policy means there is room for subjective
application of the policy.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks. Public school teachers, state and federal
police, military members, tax collectors, and other state workers are
government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies. Enforcement of
quality standards is the most obvious area. Pacing of work is a
negotiation.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In this scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters, both to the employee
and to the business. The risk of not self-identifying as a bureaucrat is
that you won’t grasp how much control you have in implementing and
enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly follow
rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and you
will harm the business/institution you are applying the rules for.
Adapting policies to circumstances is the value of having judgement
capacity.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer/citizen perspective, if you
don’t think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won’t perceive
the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as fixed and inflexible,
you will harm your ability to make progress. If a rule was made by a
human, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces the
rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a
modification or an exception?</p>
<p>if you don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you’ll behave
differently in your job. You’ll say "just tell me what to do" and you
won’t know how to engage with coworkers/bosses since they are not
friends less likely to understand how to leverage the organization;
identify collective wisdom. Explains why evangelizing within org is
relevant you’ll see your coworkers as competitors for promotion</p>
<p>if you don’t think of yourself as part of a bureaucratic process,
you’ll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won’t
perceive opportunities to negotiate because the processes seem fixed
instead of subjective You won’t recognize motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible</p>
<p>Sports, featuring well defined rules eliminates bureaucracy except
for referees</p>
<h3 id="number-of-people-in-a-bureaucracy">Number of people in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book primarily
focuses on the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization.
This might be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>) up to millions of people.</p>
<p>There are tens of companies that employ more than a million people
[see <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers">Wikipedia’s
list of largest employers</a>], including Walmart, Amazon, and
McDonald’s.</p>
<p>Small companies and non-profit organization also encounter
bureaucracy. The complexity of the tasks may be different, but the same
scale-independent patterns can emerge because of a common factor: human
behavior.</p>
<p>size of bureaucracy scales with the complexity of the problem, with
the caveat that scaling up is easier than scaling down</p>
<h3 id="what-does-bureaucracy-imply">What does Bureaucracy imply?</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, or any specific institution (corporations, governments,
academics). Bureaucracy is not defined to be efficient nor, does it have
to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not restricted to paperwork, or record
keeping, or quantification, or gathering metrics.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision
making, coordination, and processes. Involves negotiation, primarily
informal. In that context, wouldn’t it be useful to be skilled at
bureaucracy?</p>
<h3 id="why-does-bureaucracy-exist-cant-we-just-do-the-work">Why does
bureaucracy exist? Can’t we just do the work?</h3>
<p>The short answer is that bureaucracy is a response to the complexity
of a problem being solved. To see why that is, let’s start simple and
then increase the complexity.</p>
<p>The minimal scenario to start from is to imagine a single person
working on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is
relatively easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does
not recur. In that situation, building consensus is irrelevant and no
process is required.</p>
<p>Most of what you do occurs outside those limits and thus incurs some
concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks. Sometimes the order of the
subtasks matters, so we need to track the dependencies. A recurring
multi-step process with documentation is starting to have features of
bureaucracy, but lacks the need for consensus.</p>
<p>If one person lacks the skills relevant to a multi-step process, they
may engage another person to help. The interaction may be informal
(anarchy) or formalized in a contract (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">libertarian</a>). If
the parties working on the task fail to reach consensus, what is the
recourse? Options include physical violence, threats, or involving a
third party (e.g., a court with lawyers and judges).</p>
<p>The bureaucrat’s identity is subsumed into service for the
organization they are part of. At the same time, bureaucracy enables the
bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being part of a larger
organization. A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an
organization than by working alone. Sometimes the cost of being part of
the organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.</p>
<p>What if we completely avoided bureaucracy? That question is better
worded by replacing “bureaucracy" with “coordination of stakeholders".
If you avoid coordination of stakeholders, you either are constrained to
only work on tasks that involve one person, or you get is random
(uncoordinated) interactions.</p>
<p>What if we minimized bureaucracy? Again, try replacing “bureaucracy"
in that question with “coordination of stakeholders". The goal of
“minimizing coordination" probably isn’t the real objective. To be more
precise, a specific objective might be “minimize time spent executing
the task" (which takes a lot of coordination prior to the task
execution) or “minimize the level of distraction to stakeholders" (chunk
the coordination time). Another strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is
to reduce the number of stakeholders involved. For a given task
complexity, this means having smarter people who have more skills.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-bureaucracy-so-hard">Why is bureaucracy so hard?</h3>
<p>When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy,

<p>When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints
are about the incompetence of the people involved, or the
incomprehensibleness of the system. Don’t these bureaucrats know how to
do their job? Why isn’t the solution obvious? Why does this system not

<p>For the rest of us, bureaucracy is necessary for our rights. We prove
our name using paper, we claim our citizenship using paper, and those
papers are used by other to validate our claims. That’s a subjective
policy that stakeholders agree to.</p>

<h2 id="org-chart-orientation">Org chart orientation <span
id="org-chart-orientation" label="org-chart-orientation"></span></h2>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the "org chart"). Normally the CEO is
at the top of the chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed
employees are at the bottom.</p>
<p>There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CEO at the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>CEO on the left</p></li>
<li><p>CEO on the right</p></li>

<h2 id="accidental-legacy-and-essential-bureaucracy">Accidental, Legacy,
and Essential bureaucracy</h2>
<p><span data-acronym-label="essential bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">essential bureaucracy</span> is the
minimum processes and staffing and skills necessary to address the
complexity of the problem space. This is tricky since the optimization
can be with respect to resilience to change, resilience to edge cases,
staff turn-over, speed experienced by consumer, financial cost,
organization time, organization staffing level.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is either accidental or legacy. Accidental
bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what is needed, or when
skills of the people involved are insufficient for the complexity a
problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the situation changes but the
processes do not. Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem
easy: have better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to
the problem, and change processes as problems evolve.</p>
<p>Having sufficient knowledge is often infeasible, especially for
complex problems at large scale. Having the people with the right skills
assumes a pipeline of relevant talents and that people in that pipeline
won’t be poached for other problem. Keeping up with evolving problems
depends on having resources to change, and having a defined process for
changing process.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-bureaucracy">Efficient Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no bureaucracy, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information. Then the management
process of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (money, staffing) and no need to fight over
direction.</p>
<p>While that ideal scenario is not going to happen, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each person has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>each person applies the same decision making process
consistently</p></li>
<li><p>every person has the same incentives</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is inefficient is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not everyone has the same information</p></li>
<li><p>processes are inconsistent</p></li>
<li><p>incentives vary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add the issue that each person’s reference experiences are
unique. As a consequence, decision making is subjective.</p>
<p>Can any action be taken to improve bureaucratic efficiency? Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you can share information with other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can seek information from other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can strive for and demonstrate transparency</p></li>
<li><p>apply consistent processes</p></li>
<li><p>hold others (and yourself) accountable</p></li>
<li><p>account for varying incentives and reference experiences</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation-of-participants">Motivation of participants</h2>
<p>motivations of participants are rarely "how can I make the company
more successful" or even "how can I sell/produce more product"? Usually
motivation is based on personal success in various manifestations, which
leads to emergent phenomena which appears confounding to observers
outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Not too efficient such that I lose my job, and not so inefficient
that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing the efficiency
of bureaucracy is good for the organization and the outcomes, but can be
harmful to the bureaucrat’s career.</p>
<p>career stability is a benefit, and it can be leveraged to take more
risk. However, it typically manifest as inaction by an employee. There’s
no harm to the employee in not taking action. If an employee doesn’t do
anything, nothing bad will happen to that employee. Career stability
decreases extrinsic motivation.</p>
<h2 id="processes-as-a-tax-on-productivity">Processes as a tax on
Productivity</h2>
<p>The Laffer curve is a claim in economics that there is a relation
between government tax rates and the revenue from taxes collected. The
relation, based on Rolle’s theorem, says that between a tax rate of
0</p>
<p>While the mathematical statement may be provable, the use in
economics seems hand-wavy. In this post, I’ll extend that hand-waviness
to a different domain: bureaucratic processes in organizations. The
relation to the Laffer curve is that bureaucratic processes a tax on
productivity.</p>

<h2 id="teams-as-a-subdivsion-of-an-organization">Teams as a subdivsion
of an Organization</h2>
<p>In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers
available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige,
products (output)</p>
<h2 id="communication-within-a-bureaucracy">Communication within a
Bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social and Bureaucratic
interactions</h3>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social interaction example: "Did you see the game on TV last
night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting tickets
for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucratic interaction example: "You’ll need to get approval
from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their review. Then
talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>To make invisible work and invisible bureaucracy visible, document
the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s "culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social/visible bureaucracy/invisible bureaucracy is a characterization
of the culture. There are norms associated with each of these three
categories.</p>
<h3 id="communication-techniques">Communication techniques</h3>
<p>action with the deadline</p>
<p>responsiveness</p>
<p>In a bureaucracy requiring approval, or soliciting input, sometimes
waiting can provide value to the person doing the waiting. The request
may be overcome by events, or the person asking may remind which
indicates priority</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s not a communication problem but a psychological
deficit of personality</p>
<p>how to measure effectiveness: The waste or inefficiency in a
bureaucracy is a measure of the lack of coordination or inconsistent
decision making among the members</p>
<h3 id="friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Friction between
teams within an organization</h3>
<p>An organization has finite staffing, money, time. Therefore, teams
within the organization face a zero-sum distribution of resources.</p>
<p>When attempting to resolve friction between teams, there is an
authority common to the teams, but that person lacks the nuanced
insight, doesn’t have time to get involved in every challenge, and
doesn’t want to micromanage multiple teams.</p>
<h2 id="meetings-within-a-bureaucracy">Meetings within a
Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>types of meetings: internal meetings, customer meetings,
conferences</p>
<h3 id="well-run-meeting">Well-run meeting<span id="well-run_meeting"
label="well-run_meeting"></span></h3>
<p>provide agenda prior to meeting</p>
<h3 id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time compared to
theft</h3>
<p>In large organizations, there can be significant bureaucracy
associated with even small purchases. A multi-step review process may be
incurred for a $2000 acquisition.</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>Those metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people’s time.
Consider a meeting of 10 people and each person’s cost is $200 per hour.
A wasted meeting is not unusual and certainly would not incur
bureaucratic review processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally
the same – $2000. Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes
a loss of productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth
of time is not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In fact, organizations default to meetings (even recurring meetings)
rather than not meet. And being late to a meeting is accepted.</p>
<p>We can debate the differences between theft of materials and theft of
time. The financial argument is clear.</p>
