<p>Thank you to my coworkers. Our interactions me learn how to be a
better bureaucrat.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>If you have a negative impression of bureaucracy, I want to convince
you that bureaucracy is useful and that you can learn to skillfully
navigate bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, or you are thinking about how to productively contribute to
society, or you want impactful employment, or your job is not what you
expected. If you’re wondering why innovation is hard within a
bureaucratic organization, this guidebook is intended to help understand
what the challenges are.</p>
<p>Everyone in modern society is a participant in bureaucracy. The
purpose of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and
better arm you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a
bureaucrat. With focused reflection and a good guidebook, you can
improve your skills as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>This book is neither a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to
disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, the intent
is to serve as a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, or self-improvement. However, in the process of being a better
bureaucrat some lessons may apply in those domains.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex professional environments, both within
your career and outside of work. The perspectives offered in this book
can benefit you directly, whether by promotion of title, increase in
pay, successful completion of a project, or through decreased stress of
understanding how the world operates. Being a more effective bureaucrat
can also positive impact the causes you care about and the people you
engage with.</p>
<p>If you do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, you won’t know what
is your own fault, the fault of your coworkers, the fault of management,
and what is intrinsic to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>If you do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, you’re less likely
to be successful interacting with those around you. The self-recognition
of being a bureaucrat matters; how you behave and what you think your
responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle in the face of
complex large-scale systems. Thinking about complex large-scale systems
is not part of the education curriculum. This book will help you learn
about bureaucracy and lead to an increase of your ability to identify
patterns and apply relevant techniques.</p>
<p>Everyone is a bureaucrat because there are no alternatives to
bureaucracy for a society. Gaining skills in navigating bureaucracy are
helpful both for your own happiness and the well-being of a functioning
society.</p>
<p>Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is
not helpful. Automation and computers merely obfuscate processes and
make negotiation more challenging.</p>
<p>Simplifying interactions with other people to “this is characterized
merely as human relations" is an easier perspective compared to
considering bureaucracy as a complex system. However, a simplified view
either misses emergent phenomena or mischaracterizes the situation. In
either case, your effectiveness is harmed.</p>
<p>When I first started my job in a large organization I recognized
differences between the expectations of the education system I had left
and the challenges of a professional environment. Over the years I
learned from my mistakes by reflecting on my (in)actions and the
consequences. This approach has been an expensive education. My mistakes
delayed progress and damaged relationships. The motive in this book is
to provide generalizations from my experiences which might benefit the
reader.</p>
<p>In my reflections and attempting to draw lessons there is a risk of
overanalysis. Sometimes a situation is merely happenstance, and
sometimes attempting to extract lessons from randomness is folly.
Avoiding conjecture about conspiracy and malice is a fuzzy boundary when
insufficient information is available.</p>
<p>My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the
observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research or policy development. While this material is intended to be
timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the United States of
America in the early twenty first century. There are cultural blindspots
not addressed in this book because I did not encounter systemic hurdles
in my career as financially privileged white male.</p>
<p>This material is based on personal experience, reading published
materials, and anecdotes from other people. No surveys were taken to
support the claims made. No double blind experiments were conducted.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is the default option. The essentials
of bureaucracy described in § <a href="#fundamentals_of_b"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fundamentals_of_b">[fundamentals_of_b]</a> will be
familiar to experienced bureaucrats. Each section in Chapter <a
href="#b_made_of_humans" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="b_made_of_humans">[b_made_of_humans]</a> is intended to
be able to be read stand-alone. The content is intended to spark
contemplation.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-bureaucracy">Introduction to Bureaucracy</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is bureaucracy?<span
id="sec:define_bureaucracy" label="sec:define_bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>While you may know it when you see it or experience it, for this book
definitions are useful. There are three distinct roles in bureaucracy:
policy creator, policy enforcer, and the person upon whom policy is
inflicted.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> is a person
subjectively interpreting policies of an organization and has
discretionary enforcement to facilitate coordination of stakeholders on
behalf of an organization.</p>
<p>Let’s break that down piece-by-piece. First, “subjective
interpretation” means there is a person making a decision about how to
do something. “Policies" is a set of actions for a given circumstance.
“Discretionary enforcement” means the person is choosing how to apply
the policy in the specific circumstances. “Facilitating coordination”
means bureaucracy is about getting multiple people (or sometimes a
person at different instances in time) to work together. The
“stakeholders” is a group of people who care about the application of
the action in each circumstance. Finally, “an <span
data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span>" is the
collection of people for who the policy is made. That’s still pretty
dense, so the rest of the book is spent expanding on the nuances and
implications of this definition.</p>
<p>The protagonist within a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> – the person who is
a member of an organization and is responsible for subjective
implementation of policy for the organization. The person that a
bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on a <span
data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. Depending on context,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a police officer or
government official. Sometimes a bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on
other bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policy for embassy employees.</p>
<p>An organization comprised of bureaucrats is a <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>. The definition of
bureaucracy used in this book is independent of government. Nothing in
this definition involves paperwork or an office building. Definitions
that limit the concept of bureaucracy to specific contexts result in a
decreased ability to describe complex large-scale human
organizations.</p>
<p>A critical aspect of bureaucracy is that everything is made up,
specifically by other humans. The consequence is that everything is
negotiable; you need to know who to negotiate with and how to negotiate
the desired changes. The only actual rules are mathematical physics that
describe nature. Everything else is either naturally occurring
macroscopic emergent phenomena or humans making up labels and norms.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises when there is no common objectively quantifiable
feedback mechanism for individual participants in the organization. This
aspect is why governments, schools, and prisons are characterized as
bureaucratic. The military doesn’t rank soldiers by “number of enemies
killed” and is bureaucratic. Even profit-driven commercial organizations
are bureaucratic when the impacts of individual employees are not
coupled to sales metrics.</p>
<p>Profit-based feedback makes business slightly more predictable and
understandable. The questions in that context are about tactics and
whether the profit is long-term thinking versus short-term thinking.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex, long lasting,
and recurring situations involving many people. The apparent friction
can be lower when there are only a few people involved (“I’m just
talking to my collaborator" or “I’m just buying groceries from a clerk
at the store” or “I’m using a website for a government service”), but
there is a continuous gradient.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy as a macroscopic phenomenon is emergent at sufficient
scale. The scale is important because there is no longer dependence on
individual relationships (beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>. There are people in the organization that you don’t know and
for which there is no common accountability. An organization subdivided
into team recursively until there is local person-to-person
accountability.</p>
<p>The local rules bureaucrats employ to enable distributed decisions
using distributed knowledge is meetings, processes, and
communications.</p>
<p>The relevance of making a claim that something is emergent is that
there is behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale, and Knowing that
individual motives and actions of every player at the microscopic level
is not relevant</p>
<p>What does “emergent” mean? Nominal emergence example: a circle is
emergent from a collection of points. Weak emergence is measurable using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality">Granger
causality</a> or, equivalently<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy">transfer
entropy</a> (information theory).</p>
<p>Bureaucracy does not fit cleanly into game theory categories of
cooperative or competitive.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is self-modifying.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is in constant flux due to external conditions,
externally imposed constraints, staff turn-over, internal dilemmas,
disagreements of individuals.</p>
<p>Actually, bureaucracy is worse than emergent - the system rules can
be altered or ignored by the stakeholders. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">Wicked problem</a>.
This is why coming up with a holistic theory of bureaucracy is
difficult.</p>
<p>Commercial businesses have a different accountability – money. Common
across all participants within the organization, and common with
external stakeholders. The goal of a company is to generate profit.
Commercial businesses have people who make subjective decisions and
enforce policies, but there is a common metric for feedback. The
feedback mechanism is not perfect. Being a good commercial bureaucrat
does not necessarily result in monetary success.</p>
<p>Prisons, schools, medical, government, military all consume and spend
money, but money isn’t the goal. When faced with a decision, choice is
not guided by which will generate more profit. </p>
<p>Another useful way to think about bureaucracy is as a system for
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. That is in
contrast to easier-to-understand concepts like centralized knowledge and
centralized decision making. A government run by dictatorship is easy to
conceptualize compared to democracies because there is a central
character around which a narrative can be formed. Similarly, telling
stories about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> of
a company is much easier than capturing the thousands of interactions
conducted by the many employees of that company. Linear story-telling
with a small number of protagonists does not map well to the
complexities of bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy<span
id="fundamentals_of_b" label="fundamentals_of_b"></span></h2>
<p>This section provides terminology and definition for a bureaucratic
lens. Specifically bureaucracy is defined and labels for roles in
bureaucracy are named. Structure in organizations is often characterized
by hierarchy, and that hierarchy is described by an “organization
chart.” Lastly, meetings and written communication are the way in which
consensus among bureaucrats is established.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of Roles</h3>
<p>A major feature of bureaucracy is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">structure
of the organization</a> for which policies are created and carried out.
Structure in an organization is dynamic, but at any point in time an
organization typically has a defined set of roles. Those roles have
different scopes of decision authority.</p>
<p>Roles in an organization are defined by the boundaries of
responsibility. The purpose of a role is to minimize conflict and reduce
redundancy, allowing regularity and control. Clear responsibility
enables effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The choices in a hierarchy are 1) a supervisor oversees how many
people and 2) a person has how many supervisors. Naively one might
expect that an employee has one boss, but that is not a requirement. The
more people a supervisor oversees, the flatter the organization. See
<span class="citation" data-cites="2012_Valve">(unknown 2012)</span> and
<span class="citation" data-cites="1972_Joreen">(Joreen
1972)</span>.</p>
<p>The consequence of hierarchy in an organization means that as a
member of the bureaucracy you do not have full autonomy – otherwise you
would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time you are not
under strict control of the organization – you still have some
subjective decision making authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. Some autonomy is retained by all members of
the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Independent of defined roles and designated titles in an
organization’s hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a
separate social hierarchy of informal influencers and decision makers.
Informal influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships
with the decision maker or relevant credentials or both. The credentials
can be formal (e.g., a PhD) or informal (demonstrated success on a
project). In either case, the decision maker is relying on another
person’s expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relations within an organization is mentors
and mentees. These relations allow mentors to transmit institutional
knowledge to mentees, and allows people in senior positions to access
the novice perspective.</p>
<p> <br />
One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people because they think they are disempowered. A
person, Sue, is perceived to have power over another person, Amy,
because Amy gave up some control to Sue. Amy not having control creates
fear, regardless of how Sue behaves.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-chart-as-a-guide-and-a-lie">Organizational chart
as a guide and a lie</h3>
<p>An <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart">organizational
chart</a> (hereafter “org chart”) identifies roles and the relations
among roles. An org chart is at best a snapshot in time, and more often
aspirational than descriptive. In spite of possible deficiencies, an org
chart helps outsiders and newcomers understand the scope of
responsibilities and interactions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Org charts are a lie in the sense that undocumented relationships can
matter more than the official roles. Org charts fail to capture the
informal roles and network of relations that facilitate progress in any
organization.</p>
<p>Org charts foster a lie by creating sense power dynamics based on
visual orientation. For more on this issue see § <a
href="#org-chart-orientation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org-chart-orientation">[org-chart-orientation]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="meetings-for-coordination">Meetings for coordination</h3>
<p>In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are a
necessary artifact for facilitating coordination. The coordination can
be explicit, or it can be indirect through signaling.</p>
<p>Meetings are a vital aspect of coordination in a bureaucracy, so tips
are in § <a href="#well-run_meeting" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="well-run_meeting">[well-run_meeting]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="written-communication">Written Communication</h3>
<p>Reports, memos, emails are artifacts of bureaucracy in an
organization. A written record creates evidence about policies and
decisions. Existence of a record can be used for good or for harm.</p>
<h3 id="decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Decision making in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>There isn’t one answer, much less a correct answer. If there were,
there wouldn’t be a need for a decision. Even afterwards a decision can
be difficult to evaluate for correctness.</p>
<p>In bureaucratic processes there is rarely a formal assessment of
options. Decisions are rarely recorded.</p>
<p>Decision making by bureaucrats can be informal or formal,
consensus-based or solo.</p>
<p>Most decisions made by bureaucrats do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are trade-offs in timing. Sooner is better, but delaying
allows for more information gathering for a better informed
decision.</p>
<p>Where does delay come from? - Analysis paralysis, due to
<span>insufficient information, too much information, which framing is
unclear</span> - When other people who are needed to carry out the
action push back, either in disagreement or seeking clarification. The
fact that the organization is not profit driven is important because the
justification for the action isn’t quantitatively obvious. Therefore
there’s a higher burden for communication.</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat is going to rely on expert consultation, the decision
maker needs to be confident the expert is not of straying outside their
area of expertise. For example, I don’t rely on a botanist with many
published papers to tell me how to change the oil in my car.</p>
<p>When getting input for a decision, is the expert providing a factual
summary, a predictive assessment, or a value judgement?</p>
<p>There are many ways to gather evidence. Role of measurement and
modeling. Form an opinion, look for evidence to back the outcome.
Instead of measurement, most people rely on history (if they are aware
of it), or what is best for their career, or how to accumulate more
power, or what someone else says to do.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bureaucracy">History of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>After making two points in this area, I’m going to skip the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy#History">history of
bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<p>First, bureaucracy has repeatedly arisen independently in a variety
of cultures lasting for timescales that exceed the lifespan of one
person. That indicates the current situation is not a fluke or
coincidence. There is some utility (or pathology) that is consistently
recurring.</p>
<p>Second, bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans!
Subjective policy enforcement in support of an organization arises in
pre-human tribes, visible in groups of modern apes.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-bureaucracy">Scope of bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a bureaucrat?</h3>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The “policy” might simply
be “take money from customer in exchange for items and gas,” but the
subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of room for the
cashier to shape the customer’s experience. Does the cashier greet the
customer when the customer enters the store? Does the cashier look at
the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How quickly does the
cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances that are left to the cashier
in the execution of the store policy means there is room for subjective
application of the policy.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks, bankers, and plumbers. Public school
teachers, state and federal police, military members, tax collectors,
and other state workers are government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies. Enforcement of
quality standards is the most obvious area. Pacing of work is a
negotiation.</p>
<p>Structured environments like sports featuring well defined rules do
not eliminate bureaucracy. Teammates use subjective policies on who to
work with and how to best leverage their strengths and exploit the
opponent’s weaknesses. Referees make subjective determinations about
rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In this scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters, both to the employee
and to the business. The risk of not self-identifying as a bureaucrat is
that you won’t grasp how much control you have in implementing and
enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly follow
rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and you
will harm the business/institution you are applying the rules for.
Adapting policies to circumstances is the value of having judgement
capacity.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer/citizen perspective, if you
don’t think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won’t perceive
the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as fixed and inflexible,
you will harm your ability to make progress. If a rule was made by a
human, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces the
rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a
modification or an exception?</p>
<p>If you don’t think about a bureaucratic framing, you might think the
store clerk enforcing a policy is because they don’t like you, and you
might not recognize that talking with a manager could be more
productive.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you’ll behave
differently in your job. The paradigm of “just tell me what to do” is
the default (learned in school) and you won’t know how to engage with
coworkers/bosses since they are not friends. You will be less likely to
understand how to leverage the organization; identify collective wisdom.
Thinking from the perspective of a bureaucrat explains why evangelizing
within org is relevant. You’ll see your coworkers as competitors for
promotion.</p>
<p>if you think of yourself as merely a cog in a machine, you are less
likely notice that you exert influence in the process and you are less
likely to recognize the autonomy available to you. if you think "I have
a real job [e.g., nurse, cashier, teacher], so therefore I’m not a
bureaucrat", you are less likely to recognize the subjective power you
have in interactions with the public if you think, "I’m at the bottom of
my organization’s hierarchy, therefore I do not have power", you are
less likely to notice the autonomy when it is available.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as part of a bureaucratic process,
you’ll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won’t
perceive opportunities to negotiate because the processes seem fixed
instead of subjective. You won’t recognize motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-people-in-a-bureaucracy">Number of people in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book primarily
focuses on the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization.
This might be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>) up to millions of people.</p>
<p>There are tens of companies that employ more than a million people<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, including Walmart, Amazon, and
McDonald’s. Bureaucracy emerges at a far smaller scale, is scale
invariant, and is generic across sectors.</p>
<p>Small companies with a few people incur bureaucracy. Non-profit
organizations encounter bureaucracy. The complexity of the tasks may be
different, but the same scale-independent patterns can emerge because of
a common factor: human behavior.</p>
<p>Size of bureaucracy scales with the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>Scaling a bureaucracy up is easier than scaling down.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-bureaucracy-imply">What does Bureaucracy imply?</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, or any specific institution (corporations, governments,
academics). Bureaucracy is not defined to be efficient nor, does it have
to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not restricted to paperwork, or record
keeping, or quantification, or gathering metrics.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision
making, coordination, and processes. Involves negotiation, primarily
informal. In that context, wouldn’t it be useful to be skilled at
bureaucracy?</p>
<h3 id="why-does-bureaucracy-exist-cant-we-just-do-the-work">Why does
bureaucracy exist? Can’t we just do the work?</h3>
<p><strong>Theoretical perfect bureaucracy viewed by different
participants</strong></p>
<p>From the perspective of the subject of a bureaucratic organization,
perfect bureaucracy means minimizing the time the subject waits on a
decision, and means getting perfectly correct decisions, and zero cost
to the subject. Perfect bureaucracy for a bureaucrat means all
information is available, information is immediately available, and no
moral ambiguity (answer is objective). Trade-offs become trivial.</p>
<p>== no bureaucracy ==</p>
<p>no bureaucrats – just self-serve? independent resource allocation.
Might is right if you want to manage shared resources and shared
responsibility, how to decide that policy?== perfect bureaucracy with
single bureaucrat ==perfect bureaucracy comprised of a single decider –
how fast could that be?</p>
<p>Good decisions can’t be instantaneous – the OODA cycle is
necessary.</p>
<p>If OODA takes X minutes, then in a 10 hour work day that’s a max of
600/X decisions.</p>
<p>perfect bureaucracy of one person doesn’t scale.Can’t say "just
automate everything" because carrying out the approach requires a staff
to implement. Automation isn’t free – it requires creation and
maintenance</p>
<p>== complexities of more than one bureaucrat ==</p>
<p>If there’s more than one person, then communication for consensus
takes time (the "observe/orient" phases) and decreases the decision
throughput perfect bureaucracy</p>
<p>requires everyone know everyone else’s job skills and
responsibilities</p>
<p>would perfect bureaucracy involve “everyone has the same view" or
“there is a diversity of views that enable robustness"?</p>
<p><strong>Individuals working independently</strong></p>
<p>The minimal scenario to start from is to imagine a single person
working on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is
relatively easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does
not recur. In that situation, building consensus is irrelevant and no
process is required.</p>
<p>Most of what you do occurs outside those limits and thus incurs some
concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks. Sometimes the order of the
subtasks matters, so we need to track the dependencies. A recurring
multi-step process with documentation is starting to have features of
bureaucracy, but lacks the need for consensus.</p>
<p>If one person lacks the skills relevant to a multi-step process, they
may engage another person to help. The interaction may be informal
(anarchy) or formalized in a contract (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">libertarian</a>). If
the parties working on the task fail to reach consensus, what is the
recourse? Options include physical violence, threats, or involving a
third party (e.g., a court with lawyers and judges).</p>
<p><strong>A Single Decider</strong><br />
If we are going to live in a society, what if we had a single person
deciding?</p>
<p>Monarchies and dictatorships the rely on a single decider. A simpler
model to understand, but difficult to handle all the edge cases for
large society. A single decider doesn’t scale for the number of
decisions needed, so the decider then appoints bureaucrats to
subjectively implement policies.</p>
<p><strong>Elected representatives</strong><br />
Political representatives are an easier to understand concept because
it’s just one person acting in that behalf of other people. In contrast
emergent behavior of bureaucracy is more difficult to understand. TODO:
why not make the entire system out of politicians?</p>
<p>TODO: thought experiment: What if everybody in a bureaucracy were the
same? What if everybody in a bureaucracy had a different opinion?</p>
<p>If you think bureaucracy sucks and it should be removed or replaced,
then the parable of Chesterton’s fence applies. Understanding not the
history of the bureaucracy, but the reason it exists</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists ... a fence or gate erected across a road. The more
modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the
use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type
of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I
certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you
can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you
to destroy it.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that you don’t have oversight of your processes in your
finances and your resources. A small percentage of the population say
0.1%, will take advantage of that lack of a per side for their own game.
Those malicious actors show as subjects of bureaucracy and as
bureaucrats within the organization.</p>
<p>The short answer is that bureaucracy is a response to the complexity
of a problem being solved. To see why that is, let’s start simple and
then increase the complexity.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat’s identity is subsumed into service for the
organization they are part of. At the same time, bureaucracy enables the
bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being part of a larger
organization. A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an
organization than by working alone. Sometimes the cost of being part of
the organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.</p>
<p>What if we completely avoided bureaucracy? That question is better
worded by replacing “bureaucracy" with “coordination of stakeholders".
If you avoid coordination of stakeholders, you either are constrained to
only work on tasks that involve one person, or you get is random
(uncoordinated) interactions.</p>
<p>What if we minimized bureaucracy? Again, try replacing “bureaucracy"
in that question with “coordination of stakeholders". The goal of
“minimizing coordination" probably isn’t the real objective. To be more
precise, a specific objective might be “minimize time spent executing
the task" (which takes a lot of coordination prior to the task
execution) or “minimize the level of distraction to stakeholders" (chunk
the coordination time). Another strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is
to reduce the number of stakeholders involved. For a given task
complexity, this means having smarter people who have more skills.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-bureaucracy-so-hard">Why is bureaucracy so hard?</h3>
<p>When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy,
positive attribution is made to the people involved. Or ease of a
solution makes the bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems
obvious.</p>
<p>When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints
are about the incompetence of the people involved, or the
incomprehensibleness of the system. Don’t these bureaucrats know how to
do their job? Why isn’t the solution obvious? Why does this system not
work for me?</p>
<p>Sub-optimal solutions arise due to decision-makers being
under-informed, unknowledgeable, and inexperienced. Another factor is
the inability to gather data due to time constraints</p>
<p>Distinguishing features of bureaucracy:  <br />
Why are there so many rules? Why is Red tape endemic to bureaucracy?</p>
<p>To facilitate decentralized coordination.</p>
<p> <br />
Everything is slower</p>
<p> <br />
so much paperwork/forms</p>
<p> <br />
Less creativity</p>
<p> <br />
Each person in a bureaucracy has multiple roles in order to limit the
expansion of the bureaucracy. The multiple roles come from multiple
relationships necessary to span an organization larger than <a

number</a>.</p>
<p> <br />
On being productive in an organization: How much work is attributable to
cover your ass? How much work due to ill-formed decisions? How much
relevant work is carried out by insufficiently trained workers.</p>
<p>Because decisions by bureaucrats are subjective, there is significant
risk of being wrong or being called up by others as being wrong.
Therefore, a motive to cover your ass for decisions made</p>
<p>Leads to conservative decisions and risk aversion and decrease
innovation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats
hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better
results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top
of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?<a href="#fn5"

<p>Why bureaucracy is complicated : action requires information.
Information is from function which requires process which decompose to
steps. Map people who take action to steps.</p>
<h1 id="bureaucracy-in-general">Bureaucracy in general</h1>
<h2 id="each-phase-of-life-involves-bureaucracy">Each Phase of Life
involves Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>In life there are some standard milestones: birth, education, work,
death. Each of these milestones involves engaging bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In the conventional progression of life, relationships are specific
to phases. Each phase is a different experience of bureaucracy, and
different roles act as bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Birth is marked by getting a name, registering with the state,
initiating medical records. These tasks are administered by bureaucrats
who manage the processes that implement policies.</p>
<p>pre-education childhood: primarily family, possible community
members, caretakers</p>
<p>The education process involves the community, typically as a public
school, private school, or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the
frontline bureaucrat is the teacher.</p>
<p>The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate,
graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a
large organization.</p>
<p>Where you sit in the classroom matters. Being in the front means you
will be exposed to fewer distractions, more likely to pay attention.</p>
<p>How were you taught? Did you have any input on the method? Who
taught? Did you like them? Were they friendly, knowledgeable, and
approachable? How did you learn? What worked best? What didn’t work, and
why not? What did you learn? What do you wish you had learned?</p>
<p>What resources are available now for you to learn from? Do you like
learning? you have the freedom to pursue what ever intellectual
endeavors you want</p>
<p>you get to choose the book you want. You don’t even need to pick just
one – you can pick lots of books and figure out which author style best
fits you. You can also choose the level of difficulty – very basic and
beginner level, or more advanced (depending on where you are, rather
than where a class in school is supposed to be).</p>
<p>25 years of school did not prepare me for addressing challenges at
work. I learned how to approach technical issues and develop solutions.
Problem and solution paradigm removed the negotiation and situation
discovery steps. While in school I limited socializing. I’ve found that
social skills and political savvy are at least as important for getting
significant change implemented. I’ve accepted this reality. If I had
been aware of this gap earlier in my career, the projects I worked on
that failed adoption by users may have been more successful</p>
<p>primary education: family, friends, teachers</p>
<p>education process roles and expectations vary over time</p>
<p>college, graduate school: friends, teachers, advisors</p>
<p>Less than 0.5% of the United States population serves in the
military. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The military, with rigid hierarchy and defined protocols, is also a
distinct experience.</p>
<p>Within the employment phase, there are pairs start and end events
which may apply: hiring or getting hired; firing, getting fired, or
quitting.</p>
<p>employment: managers above you, peer employees, people you manage are
all members of an organization.</p>
<p>healthcare. Doctors and nurses are bureaucrats; the hospital or
clinic is the organization.</p>
<p>Death can invoke both the medical system and the government.</p>
<p>All of these roles and relationship involve subjectively administered
policies within an organization. However, merely recognizing the role of
bureaucrats is not a complete description of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Toilet paper at the hospital If you go to a hospital, use the
bathroom, and find there is no toilet paper, that would indicate a
deficiency. Someone didn’t refill the toilet paper. Since the person who
normally refills toilet paper wasn’t also a user, they aren’t directly
impacted by the lack of toilet paper. So someone needs to have a routine
of checking bathrooms for toilet paper availability. Money spent
checking to toilet paper is money not spent on the primary mission of
the hospital. Minimizing checking is important, so a feedback mechanism
is instituted – a phone number to text regarding bathroom status at the
hospital.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-bureaucracy-is-nearly-impossible">Avoiding bureaucracy
is nearly impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
completely on your own, with no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging with society. Even then, personal routines
are a self-imposed bureaucracy.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, as members of a society bureaucracy is necessary
for our rights. We prove our name by cooperating with other people, and
our name helps us claim our citizenship. That’s a subjective policy that
<span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">stakeholders</span> in society agree
to.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy are attractive alternatives
bureaucracy. The way participants in modern society strive for
self-sufficiency is by denying their dependence on modern society.
That’s a relabeling of selfishness which feels better.</p>
<p>The specific way a society is constructed (democratic, authoritarian,
dictatorship, anarchy) is irrelevant – bureaucracy is still present.
Even the libertarian view of relying on contract enforcement implies
some about of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Not all bureaucracy is due to the state, nor is bureaucracy confined
to companies. Parenting involves coming up with situation-specific
requirements for children, with the organization being the family. Dress
codes for team are arbitrary standards inconsistently enforced. Store
clerks are bureaucrats, as are website forum moderators. Content
moderation is the process of inconsistently enforcing arbitrary
standards. This mindset even permeates individuals as internalized
expectations of policy and enforcement when no one else is present.</p>
<p>Recognizing instances of bureaucracy enables more skillful
interaction, whether as a bureaucrat or as a subject. The remainder of
this section illustrates both the view of a person interacting with
bureaucracy as a <span data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>, and the perspective
of bureaucrats working within organizations.</p>

<h2 id="accidental-legacy-and-essential-bureaucracy">Accidental, Legacy,
and Essential bureaucracy</h2>
<p><span data-acronym-label="essential bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">essential bureaucracy</span> is the
minimum processes and staffing and skills necessary to address the
complexity of the problem space. This is tricky since the optimization
can be with respect to resilience to change, resilience to edge cases,
staff turn-over, speed experienced by consumer, financial cost,
organization time, organization staffing level.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is either accidental or legacy. Accidental
bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what is needed, or when
skills of the people involved are insufficient for the complexity a
problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the situation changes but the
processes do not. Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem
easy: have better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to
the problem, and change processes as problems evolve.</p>
<p>Having sufficient knowledge is often infeasible, especially for
complex problems at large scale. Having the people with the right skills
assumes a pipeline of relevant talents and that people in that pipeline
won’t be poached for other problem. Keeping up with evolving problems
depends on having resources to change, and having a defined process for
changing process.</p>
<h2 id="efficient-bureaucracy">Efficient Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no bureaucracy, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information. Then the management
process of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (money, staffing) and no need to fight over
direction.</p>
<p>While that ideal scenario is not going to happen, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each person has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>each person applies the same decision making process
consistently</p></li>
<li><p>every person has the same incentives</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is inefficient is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not everyone has the same information</p></li>
<li><p>processes are inconsistent</p></li>
<li><p>incentives vary</p></li>
<li><p>Imprecise language</p></li>
<li><p>Using opinions and experience rather than collect data and
analyze data</p></li>
<li><p>prioritizing by putting out fires rather than attacking largest
issues</p></li>
<li><p>not responding to communications (email, phone,
meetings)</p></li>
<li><p>being late to meetings</p></li>
<li><p>scope creep</p></li>
<li><p>planned scope and capability scope (due to staffing or skills) is
mismatched</p></li>
<li><p>silos of operation</p></li>
<li><p>lies</p></li>
<li><p>mistakes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add the issue that each person’s reference experiences are
unique. As a consequence, decision making is subjective.</p>
<p>Can any action be taken to improve bureaucratic efficiency? Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you can share information with other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can seek information from other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can strive for and demonstrate transparency</p></li>
<li><p>apply consistent processes (rather than being reactionary and

<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
inefficient</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Expressed by both subjects and bureaucrats
who observe seemingly wasteful processes. <em>What this is missing</em>:
If bureaucracy were truly inefficient (not allocating resources in the
most efficient way), then it would be replaced by a more efficient
approach. The key is to ask, “efficient with respect to what metric?”
The metric of money, time, number of people, stability, robustness to
perturbation. Second, what would motivate improved efficiency? Without
incentives, change is less likely.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is due to
malfeasance. The specific number of malicious bureaucrats ranges from
“all of the participants” to “just enough to be
problematic.”</strong><br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: There are bad actors. <em>What this is
missing</em>: Bureaucracy is unavoidable, and most of the participants
are earnestly trying to help or are not making a positive contribution.
Processes within bureaucracy are used to deal with malicious
bureaucrats, like isolation or promotion.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Organizations are composed of
individuals with personalities, and the inefficiency is attributable to
a mashing together of distinct individuals with conflicting
desires.</strong><br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: It is true! (It isn’t complete.)<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Other aspects like history of the
processes (legacy) and protection against malicious subjects and

law of business balance</a>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>:<br />

<p>A simple decision is one that has one good choice and one or more bad
choices. The work is to identify which is the good choice and select
that option.</p>
<p>A complex decision may have many choices, and there are might not be
a best option. Then a Pareto frontier might exist where trade-offs can
be made.</p>
<p>When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that
presents a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma">dilemma</a>.
The name for the case with three viable options is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>.</p>
<p>Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for the decision maker. Any
selection is going to have downsides, and any compromise will be
suboptimal.</p>
<p>The following are presented as dilemmas, but that oversimplifies both
the continuous nature of the trade-off and the alternative creative
approaches to a specific situation. The reason to be aware of these
dilemmas to be able to ponder them prior to the pressure of real-time
decision making.</p>
<p>The dilemmas are all happening at the same time and all the time, and
they are inter-dependent. Making a choice for one dilemma shapes the
options available in other dilemmas.</p>
<p>These dilemmas are presented in no particular order.</p>

<p>Trilemma: <strong>Do you work for your team, your manager, or
yourself?</strong> Being a member of a team that operates within a
hierarchy is tough. One reason is the question of who you are working
for. The trilemma is whether you work for yourself, work for your
supervisor, or work for your team. Ideally you can find ways to do all
three, but that is not always the case.</p>
<p>Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a
potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each
team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the
action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy –
they are accountable to the boss.</p>
<p>In the approach "team members are directed by their supervisor," the
synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck
(for decision making and for creativity and for planning).</p>
<p>The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their
supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in
an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers.</p>
<p> <br />
A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are
<strong>fast, inexpensive, good; choose two</strong>. (This is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Project
management triangle</a>.)<br />
In other words, the options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of
resources)</p></li>
<li><p>good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., a clever
solution)</p></li>
<li><p>fast and inexpensive will be low quality</p></li>

<h2 id="unavoidable-hazards-of-bureaucracy">Unavoidable Hazards of
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:unavoidable_hazards"
label="sec:unavoidable_hazards"></span></h2>
<p>In a bureaucracy there are certain aspects which will be problematic
and cannot be avoided. The value in recognizing them is to understand
that there isn’t a local anomaly. The cause isn’t you, the people you
with, or the organization you are a bureaucrat in.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>responsibility without authority</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Diffusion of blame in the bureaucracy</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Rarely get to pick who is on the team</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Rarely able to alter team membership</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>inadequate resources: staffing, time, money</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>outcomes for the team are ill-defined and constantly
shifting</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>the organization has a lack of vision; or has vision but no
plan; or has vision and plan but no consensus.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>progress depends on subjective decision making</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Bureaucracy is inefficient</strong><br />
Different participants have different motives, and the aggregation
needed for coordination is inefficient regardless of what metric
efficiency is measured against.</p>
<p>Another example: Inefficiency of changing the requirements on a
project partway through. If an objective quantitative measure were
available, the ROI could be determined.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Scope creep</strong><br />
The customer wants more, and the exploration of what’s possible is
exciting (a positive experience).</p>
<p>The creator hears more work. This implies a few trade-off options,
all of which are negative for one or both parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sticking with the original terms (telling the customer "no",
which is negative for both parties)</p></li>
<li><p>re-negotiation for additional compensation (a burden to both
parties)</p></li>
<li><p>the programmer doing more for the same pay, which means less
money per effort (yielding a less happy programmer)</p></li>
<li><p>decreasing existing efforts to fit the additional new
requirements (yielding a less happy customer)</p></li>
<li><p>even if the programmer is getting paid by the hour, additional
work means the end product will be delayed to accommodate additional
features (yielding a less happy customer)</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
<strong>Migrating technologies</strong><br />
The person implementing the transition has to be educated in both the
old and new technology. the legacy code has to be migrated to the new
implementation convincing stakeholders; may require synchronization
difficulty scales with the number of stakeholders</p>

<p>This section focuses on a bureaucrat’s initial exposure to
bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-read">What to read<span id="sec:to_read"
label="sec:to_read"></span></h3>
<p>The content of this book is independent of the specific role you as a
bureaucrat will be playing. We will assume you are striving to be a good
person, and that you have relevant education/experience for the position
in the organization.</p>
<p>The following reading lists are outside the scope of a guidebook for
bureaucracy. Bureaucracy involves hierarchy, so understanding the
mechanics and nuances of hierarchical roles is useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a

</ul>
<p>Reading management books is helpful regardless of whether you are a
manager, want to become a manager, or if you never want to become a
manager. In all three cases, gaining awareness of best practices and
alternative approaches benefits you as a bureaucrat and the people you
coordinate with – bosses, peer bureaucrats, subordinates, and
subjects.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-into-a-bureaucracy">Hiring into a Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Hiring shapes the culture of an organization and determines what is
feasible, both by the skills of those hired and how well new hires
integrate with the existing organization.</p>
<p>Hiring is an expensive process in terms of money, time, emotional
investment of candidates, and the burden of reviewing applicants.</p>
<p>When hiring into an organization there is a selection bias in the
people who join a bureaucracy, and there is a selection bias who stays
in bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specifics of the job, there are specific attributes
that make a candidate more likely to be successful in a bureaucracy. In
addition to role-specific skills, hire for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>,
social skills, and intrinsic motivation.</p>
<h3 id="promotion">Promotion</h3>
<p>Promotion is a critical aspect of designing incentives for behavior.
Promotion is central because there are a variety of motives – for money,
for status, for authority.</p>
<p>promotion of individual (rather than team) results in hero
culture</p>
<p>What is preventing innovation is lack of risk taking. Actual risk
means potential for failure. fear of failure because culture avoids
failure due to concerns of waste. Also, anyone who fails can use this
argument, but that isn’t the same as “fail fast” because what’s critical
is learning from failure and sharing that insight gained so other’s
don’t need to repeat.</p>
<p>two options for learning: your own mistakes, or the mistakes of
others. "formal education" is about the latter</p>
<h3 id="organization-chart-orientation">Organization chart orientation
<span id="org-chart-orientation"
label="org-chart-orientation"></span></h3>
<p>How an organization’s culture is conveyed by artifacts like org
charts is subtle and can be overanalyzed.</p>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the “org chart"). Normally the CEO is
at the top of the chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed
employees are at the bottom. See Fig. <a
href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">3.1</a></p>

<h3 id="professional-training-aka-continuing-education">Professional
Training, aka Continuing Education</h3>
<p>There is often a disconnect between the results formal education and
the specific needs of the organization. Professional training is
intended to fill that gap.</p>
<h2 id="you-are-an-individual-in-an-organization">You are an Individual
in an Organization</h2>
<p>This section focuses on the individual bureaucrat operating within an
organization.</p>
<p>There is no neutral member of a bureaucracy. Either you are
contributing to the organization, or you are sapping resources from the
organization. This is because the organization operates in a zero-sum
game for resource allocation.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-of-participants">Motivation of participants</h3>
<p>In an organization where you are a paid bureaucrat, you are either
actively working for improvement of the organization, or your existence
is parasitic to the organization. There is no "idle" status for paid
employees.</p>
<p>Motivations of participants are rarely “how can I make the company
more successful" or even “how can I sell/produce more product"? Usually
motivation is based on personal success in various manifestations, which
leads to emergent phenomena which appears confounding to observers
outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Not too efficient such that I lose my job, and not so inefficient
that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing the efficiency
of bureaucracy is good for the organization and the outcomes, but can be
harmful to the bureaucrat’s career.</p>
<p>Career stability is a benefit, and it can be leveraged to take more
risk. However, it typically manifests as inaction by an employee.
There’s no harm to the employee in not taking action. If an employee
doesn’t do anything, nothing bad will happen to that employee. Career
stability decreases extrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>motivations: stability, money, travel, problem solving, like being
associated with org, logistical convenience (“the office is near where I
lived.”)</p>
<h3 id="creating-change-in-the-organization">Creating change in the
organization<span id="sec:creating_change"
label="sec:creating_change"></span></h3>
<p>If the organization you are a participant in has no problems or
challenges, this subsection can be skipped. For bureaucrats in
organizations that do have structural problems, this part of the
guidebook provides points to ponder independent of the specific
problem.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you have unique insight on the problems the
organization faces, and you have unique leverage to alter the situation.
While you could proceed haphazardly, an effective bureaucrat has vision,
goals that break down the vision, plans on how to achieve each goal, and
milestones which indicate whether the plan is proceeding.</p>
<p>Perspectives to consider when assessing change include what the
situation is, what the situation could be, and what the situation looks
like from different perspectives</p>
<p>Confounding your ability to improve the organization, there are
people around you who have conflicting visions or no vision. There are
different views on whether something is actually a problem, different
prioritizations, and different approaches to addressing problems.</p>
<p>A trade-off to consider is that having niche impact is easier than
broad change. There’s also a trade-off of the quick fix versus more
robust solutions.</p>
<p>For a given structural problem in an organization, options include
technical solutions, changing policy, or changing cultural norms of
participants.</p>
<p>determine social/political/technical impediments.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Before starting a new effort, check to see whether this
has been tackled before. Learn the history of the problem. Why hasn’t
this been solved?</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Query your first and second order social network</p>

<p><em>Tip</em>: hear criticism and respond</p>
<h3 id="measuring-bureaucratic-maturity-of-bureaucrats">Measuring
Bureaucratic Maturity of Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic maturity of bureaucrats in an organization can be broken
into three behaviors:</p>
<p>The first and most wide spread behavior is to observe a problem and
then complain about the situation. This indicates awareness of the
environment but no creativity regarding what to do about the
problems.</p>
<p>The second, less common behavior, is to observe a problem and
recognize the situation as an opportunity. This requires creativity and
reframing.</p>
<p>The third behavior is to observe a problem and then nudge the
situation towards a vision. The nudges could be through either direct
action or by influencing others.</p>
<p>An individual bureaucrat can exhibit one or more of these behaviors.
That is, being capable of the third behavior does not mean the person
lacks the ability to complain on other topics.</p>
<p>There is not a specific amount of experience within the organization
needed to arrive at any of these three paradigms. A holistic
understanding of the system certainly helps.</p>
<p>The “vision" of the third behavior could be in the form of a
long-term (temporally distant) outcome, or the vision could be of
immediate multi-party cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="actual-time-spent-working">Actual time spent working</h3>
<p>In a bureaucracy the actual time spent working is less than the
number of hours you get paid for. Breaks during work, vacation from

<h3 id="tips-for-working-as-a-bureaucrat-in-an-organization">Tips for
working as a bureaucrat in an organization</h3>
<p>Superpowers of a bureaucrat in a bureaucratic organization that
facilitate cooperation and progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>be more transparent</p></li>
<li><p>make yourself accountable</p></li>
<li><p>communicate more effectively</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-tasking, or, more accurately, task switching. The switch
among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an
externally-generated pause. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation">pipeline
your activities</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Be prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone shows
up with resources.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to
enable your progress, <u>presence creates priority</u>.</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly replying to incoming requests. This allows other people’s
tasks to either be resolved or have a clear response about when progress
can be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>intellectual empathy – what is it; how to grow it. Theory of mind
for thinking. shadow peers and bosses</p></li>
<li><p>process empathy. Observe deviations and exceptions that cause
processes to come into existence.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid unintentionally dropping tasks or requests. This requires
capturing incoming requests and then providing a response about
prioritization and status. This matters because other participants in
the organization should regard you as reliable in a positive
sense.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bureaucracy induces emotional response in participants because things
don’t work they way each person wants. This can lead emotionally to
frustration and then apathy. Understanding how things operate in a
bureaucracy decreases the anger.</p>
<p>Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of
powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some third person decides your fate: this is the whole essence of
bureaucracy.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to
subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The sense of powerlessness is somewhat valid, in that you are as a
bureaucrat giving up some power compared to your ability to act
individually. That is the trade for working with others</p>
<p> <br />
A process feels bureaucratic when the subject is exposed to more than
one step to get something done that if one person were doing it would be
simpler. Consolidation from the subject’s perspective decreases the
apparent bureaucracy. The barrier to implementation is the necessary
coordination among different stakeholders who receive no benefit from
the coordination. Externalizing the coordination to the subject is what
causes the sense of bureaucracy.</p>
<p> <br />
Don’t rely on one person or one idea for your success. Don’t spread
yourself too thin.</p>
<p> <br />
When you are asked to take on additional work, avoid responding with
“that’s not my job." If the request is misguided and your perception is
that is really is the responsibility of another person, ask if the
requester is aware of that other person’s responsibilities. If you are
to really take on the work, get guidance on re-prioritizing and make
sure the request is documented in writing.</p>
<p> <br />
If there’s something you want to accomplish, strive for influence
without authority instead of working to gain control over resources
(e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following: “In this organization X
is important to me, but I can’t do X right now because I don’t have
enough power in the org. So I’ll get promoted and then do X."</p>

<p>enumerate tropes to figure how to respond</p>
<p>Solo work may be more emotionally rewarding due to fewer external
constraints, but the cost is complexity and scope being limited to the
skills of the individual.</p>
<p>Working with others allows you to occasionally accomplish complex
results beyond your own skills or your own bandwidth in spite of
collaborators not being under your control. How? Through persuasion.</p>
<p>The challenge of collaboration is to multiply productivity rather
than merely sum the output of a set of individuals.</p>

by internal contracts or even service level agreements. What holds the
organization together? Force of will of participants.</p>

<h3 id="not-my-job-task-scope">Not my job: task scope</h3>
<p>If I ask someone for help on a task that benefits the team, that
person might respond that the task is “not my job" and time spent on
tasks like that “gets in the way" of their progress. The interesting
(emotionally rewarding) work is not that task.</p>
<p>The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>will not get them promoted</p></li>
<li><p>scope of their job and their expertise does not include the
task</p></li>
<li><p>they don’t know how to do the task and they don’t want to

<p>Relation between Reputation and Brand and Political Capital? Same
thing?</p>
<p>How does an individual create and accumulate political capital? What
does political capital mean with respect to teams?</p>
<p>Reputation matters for influence. How other people perceive you
impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek out your help or
input.</p>
<p>Your reputation is actively changing based on your activities and
communication – both your communication and the stories others tell
about you.</p>
<p>Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to the
stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation
requires engaging people and generating evidence.</p>
<p>Reputation is set whenever and where ever you are observed, or
artifacts are associated with you. What you wear, when you show up, how
your emails appear, body posture in meetings.</p>
<p>Reputation is perception of the person the bureaucrat is engaging
with. What does that person think of you?</p>
<p>Ideally that would be a function of their technical skill, ability to
collaborate with other people, the strength of their network,
creativity. None of this matters if the person you’re engaging with
doesn’t know those things.</p>
<p>Based on your reputation, what trust does that person have?</p>
<p>To spend reputation is to bend the rules.</p>
<p>Spending reputation means taking risk that involve other people</p>

<h3 id="teams-as-a-subdivsion-of-an-organization">Teams as a subdivsion
of an Organization</h3>
<p>In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers
available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige,
products (output)</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-expertise">Leveraging Expertise</h3>
<p><strong>For experts looking to help non-expert decision
makers</strong></p>
<p>non-experts think and speak less precisely</p>
<p>You, the expert, may not win any debates based on number of years of
experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However,
expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from.</p>
<p>Identify which party (you, the expert, or the audience) has broader
diversity of situations.</p>
<p>respect and account for the expertise of the audience (especially
when they work in a different field). Acknowledge your own limits.</p>
<p>Don’t rely completely on expertise as a single dimensional relation.
Find ways to relate personally to audience members. They will need to
build trust in you personally.</p>
<p>Facilitate the audience setting the goals. They should be able to
identify how success is defined.</p>
<p>Identify strengths your audience has and build on those.</p>
<p>You don’t have to teach a group all-at-once. One-on-one teaching is
more customizable, and the audience may feel less worried about asking
dumb questions.</p>
<p>Once you’ve taught more than one person, they can help each other
translate the skill.</p>
<p><strong>For non-experts looking for expertise</strong></p>
<p>Experts may lack experience communicating their knowledge.</p>
<p>Experts are cautious to include caveats and limitations</p>
<p>Translation process is necessary from "here’s what’s known in
general" + "situation specific facts" to "plan of (in)action" and what’s
realistic with what confidence.</p>
<p>Experts straying outside their expertise are dangerous because the
boundary may not be clear to the audience.</p>
<p>How to recruit an advisor if you don’t have expertise yourself:
triangulate. Seek guidance from your existing social network. Advisor
should be opinionated (not meek) but adaptive to new information.</p>

<h3 id="tactic-approval-forgiveness-opposition">Tactic: Approval,
Forgiveness, Opposition</h3>
<p>A common bureaucratic task is consensus regarding action or expending
resources. There are distinct options about how to get that
consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval before taking action. This approach incurs both
providing justification and waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness after taking action. Often viewed as being in
contrast to seeking approval. Less delay, and usually works if things go
well or if no one notices.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Intent with deadline for response. The window for
response should be sufficient to actually allow feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition before taking action. This is a different
framing from approval or forgiveness. It decreases the risk the approver
has to take on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p>Most organization default to an approval-based processes. Each new
idea needs to be signed off as approved by a sequential list of
bureaucrats. The sequence (not concurrent) process may be known in
advance, or it may be ad hoc if the request is novel.</p>
<p>Relying on approval is harmful to innovation because sign-off by each
bureaucrat is interpeted as “I am 100% in agreement with this.” Each
stakeholder has to bless innovation and tie their reputation to the
outcome.</p>
<p>The “I won’t stop this” (soliciting opposition) is a more useful
paradigm. With the consensus process language changed to "I won’t stop
this," then the bureaucrat can avoid taking responsibility for the idea
and therefore are not tying their reputation to the result.</p>
<h3 id="static-and-dynamic-process">Static and Dynamic Process<span
id="sec:static-dynamic_processes"
label="sec:static-dynamic_processes"></span></h3>
<p>Change within an organization is to be expected since the external
environment the organization exists in is not static. With that premise,
why are static processes that are not robust to change created in the
first place? Answer: so policy creators can point to an effort and avoid
looking neglectful.</p>
<p>Creating robust processes that are dynamic takes more investment.
First, the underlying process must be documented. What is expected to
happen? Who are the stakeholders? This logic is what is fragile to
change. Second, document assumptions used in the process. If the
assumptions are invalidated, then the process is broken and needs to be
discarded or at least revised.</p>
<p>The problem is that even when the process is documented and
assumptions enumerated, they may not be checked to see if revision is
necessary. Measurements need to be periodically taken to see if the
assumptions are still applicable. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision">Sunset
provisions</a> have a similar intent of forcing renewal.</p>
<p>A more quantitative approach is to tie a process to a cost/benefit
model. The benefit to implementing a process comes at some cost. If the
assumptions of the process can be tied to a cost/benefit model, then we
can determine whether the process is worth implementing. Periodic
measurements are needed to update the cost/benefit model and determine
whether the process is effective.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucratic-debt">Bureaucratic Debt<span
id="sec:bureaucratic_debt" label="sec:bureaucratic_debt"></span></h3>
<p>Suppose a process is implemented now, and later found to be
ineffective. Some work is needed to revise the process and hopefully
improve effectiveness. <span data-acronym-label="bureaucratic debt"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucratic debt</span> is the cost
of that work needed to change a process. The bureaucratic debt is caused
by choosing an easy solution now (with limited information or
insufficient resources) instead of using a better approach that would
take longer to design and implement.</p>
<p>The purpose of defining this concept is to capture the otherwise
unaccounted work resulting from decisions.</p>
<p>Decisions occur in a resource constrained environment (e.g.,
insufficient time, money, labor). Each decision made results in options
that are not explored. Some of these missed opportunities are associated
with short-term versus long-term trade-offs of costs.</p>
<p>These opportunity costs (what the organization doesn’t do) alters
which future decisions become available.</p>
<p>Getting information (measurement) and analysis are costly in terms of
money, time, skill, and labor.</p>
<p>Once the concept of bureaucratic debt is recognized, the question is
how to track it.</p>
<p>To document bureaucratic debt, we need to capture decisions as they
are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what is the decision to be made?</p></li>
<li><p>when the decision was identified?</p></li>
<li><p>when the decision was made?</p></li>
<li><p>who made the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>what options were identified?</p></li>
<li><p>which option was chosen?</p></li>
<li><p>what that option was chosen over the other options</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of documenting decisions is to enable both aversion to
bad decisions and attraction to good decisions. Without documenting
decisions, there is no transparency, accountability, or historical
ability to track dependencies.</p>
<p>The documentation of decisions needs to be disseminated to
stakeholders. This should occur as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>The scale of decision impact determines the level of documentation.
"Do I choose pencil or pen?" incurs negligible bureaucratic debt;
therefore the documentation needed is also negligible. Projecting impact
of decisions is a subjective prediction.</p>
<p>Similarities of technical debt and bureaucratic debt. In developing
software, there are three artifacts: the software, documentation on how
to use the software, and documentation on why to use the software. The
two distinct types of documentation are typically combined in one
document. Each of these three artifacts are independent. The
ramification of this is that each artifact can be created independently,
and it takes work to maintain synchronization of the artifacts.</p>
<p>Similarly for a bureaucracy, there is the processes and policies
which get applied to customers, the documentation of what those
processes and policies are, and guidance on when the processes and
policies should be applied. As with technical debt, these three aspects
are independent.</p>
<h3 id="design-processes-for-turnover-of-staff">Design processes for
Turnover of Staff</h3>
<p>When designing a process, there are a few goals to optimize for:

<h3 id="processes-as-a-tax-on-productivity">Processes as a tax on

<p>The Laffer curve is a claim in economics that there is a relation
between government tax rates and the revenue from taxes collected. The
relation, based on Rolle’s theorem, says that between a tax rate of
0</p>
<p>While the mathematical statement may be provable, the use in
economics seems hand-wavy. In this post, I’ll extend that hand-waviness
to a different domain: bureaucratic processes in organizations. The
relation to the Laffer curve is that bureaucratic processes a tax on
productivity.</p>
<h2 id="communication-within-a-bureaucracy">Communication within a

<h3 id="role-of-communication-within-a-bureaucracy">Role of

<p>Communication facilitates coordination of processes and allocation of

<p>Coordination among participants is one way to break the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">Prisoner’s

times and skill; not everyone is willing to invest in communication that
is seen as not “doing the work". Additionally, accounting for the<br />
href<span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve</span><span>Allen

consensus at an optimal approach for a given situation may exceed time
available for solving the problem.</p>
<h3 id="communication-preferences">Communication Preferences</h3>
<p>There are typically multiple communication channels available between
bureaucrats in an organization. Phone, email, chat, in-person,
voicemail, websites, video calls, calendars, message boards.</p>
<p>Do you know which channel is preferred for what purpose? Can you list
your own preferences, and the preferences of other stakeholders?</p>
<p>Do you keep your calendar up-to-date? Or is your calendar irrelevant?
Is your calendar visible to your coworkers?</p>
<p>Text chat is useful for asynchronous interrupts. Text chats are
better than stopping by in person or calling on the phone since
in-person drive-bys and phone calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking
about or discussing. The purpose of the text chat is either a reminder
or seeking a convenient time to talk.</p>
<p>Email is useful for notifications or questions or setting up
logistics. If I don’t respond to a question or request for action within
2 days, please send a reminder.</p>
<p>Video calls are my preferred method for group meetings. Group
meetings via video call scheduled in advance on my calendar are best.
Impromptu video calls are acceptable but as interruptive as a phone
call.</p>
<p>In-person discussions are my preferred method for one-on-one
discussions. Stopping by my desk without an appointment interrupts
whatever I’m thinking about. If a calendar invitation is inconvenient, a
text chat confirming my availability prior to the in-person discussion
is helpful.</p>
<p>Phone is useful when the caller is unable to be present in-person.
Phone, being voice-only, is inferior to video calls. Unscheduled phone
calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking about. I’ve intentionally disabled
voicemail.</p>
<p>Status updates in electronic issue trackers or wikis or forums are
best (rather than email-only). Notifying in text chat or email that a
wiki page or issue is updated is helpful but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Given all those caveats, I prefer communication in any form at any
time over surprises.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether you should communicate, default to
communicating. If you’re not sure whether communication would interrupt
something, check my calendar and then communicate. If it’s urgent or
blocking progress, ignore my calendar.</p>
<h3 id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social and Bureaucratic
interactions</h3>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social interaction example</em>: “Did you see the game on TV
last night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting
tickets for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bureaucratic interaction example</em>: “You’ll need to get
approval from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their
review. Then talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>To make invisible work and invisible bureaucracy visible, document
the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s "culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social/visible bureaucracy/invisible bureaucracy is a characterization
of the culture. There are norms associated with each of these three
categories.</p>
<h3 id="communication-techniques">Communication techniques</h3>
<p>action with the deadline</p>
<p>responsiveness</p>
<p>In a bureaucracy requiring approval, or soliciting input, sometimes
waiting can provide value to the person doing the waiting. The request
may be overcome by events, or the person asking may remind which
indicates priority</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s not a communication problem but a psychological
deficit of personality</p>
<p>how to measure effectiveness: The waste or inefficiency in a
bureaucracy is a measure of the lack of coordination or inconsistent
decision making among the members</p>
<h3 id="friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Friction between
teams within an organization</h3>
<p>Ideally there is a clear division of responsibilities among teams.
Even in that context there is necessarily some interaction among teams –
one team may depend on the output from another team. Coordination among
the teams regarding transfer of data or products or projects or
knowledge is critical to the smooth operation of the organization.</p>
<p>An organization has finite staffing, money, time. Therefore, teams
within the organization face a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a>
distribution of resources.</p>
<p>Difference of decision making perspective based on local conditions,
stupidity, or different incentives, different definitions of success</p>
<p>When attempting to resolve friction between teams, there is an
authority common to the teams, but that person lacks the nuanced
insight, doesn’t have time to get involved in every challenge, and
doesn’t want to micromanage multiple teams.</p>
<h2 id="meetings-within-a-bureaucracy">Meetings within a
Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Stakeholders care about the outcome of a decision. In some sense,
every participant in an organization is invested the outcome of every
decision made because there is consequence to how resources are
allocated and the direction of the organization. Every org member has an
opinion, even lacking experience or expertise.</p>
<h3 id="characterizing-meetings">Characterizing Meetings</h3>
<p>Characterizing meetings is critical to distinguishing which norms are
applicable, and what people expect from the different formats.</p>
<p>types of meetings: internal meetings, customer meetings,
conferences</p>
<p>Many purpose to a meeting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To gather input from attendees</p></li>
<li><p>To make a pronouncement to attendees</p></li>
<li><p>To educate</p></li>
<li><p>To brainstorm ideas</p></li>
<li><p>To make progress towards an objective</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the purpose is not explicitly stated, confusion arises.</p>
<p>When multiple purposes occur in one meeting and the transition is not
explicitly stated, confusion arises. The reason for this confusion is
that the assumptions and expectations and norms of each purpose are
different. When the attendees don’t know the purpose or the purpose
shifts, the behaviors and roles are in question.</p>
<p>Level of formality, start time (early | on time | late), end time
(early | on time | late), utility, duration, number of attendees, number
of speakers, number of participants.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of a meeting?</p>
<p>meetings involve people, either known or strangers meetings involve
information, either relevant or irrelevant. Relevant information is
either new or related to previous work meetings either have a leader or
no leader (brainstorming). If there’s a leader, the leader may be
disseminating info to participants, or gathering information from
attendees</p>
<h3 id="well-run-meeting">Well-run meeting<span id="well-run_meeting"
label="well-run_meeting"></span></h3>
<p>Identify essential attendees. If someone does not need to be present,
notify them in advance that you will share the meeting notes
afterwards.</p>
<p>Bad: no meeting agenda<br />
Good: agenda<br />
Better: agenda share with other participants</p>
<p>For formal meetings, share agenda in writing prior to meeting.</p>
<p>For formal in-person meetings, Verify meeting venue has sufficient
space, seating, working IT equipment</p>
<p>For formal virtual meetings, ensure participants are familiar with
virtual meeting controls</p>
<h3 id="make-effective-presentations">Make Effective Presentations<span
id="sec:presentations" label="sec:presentations"></span></h3>
<p>By paying attention to a bad presentation, you can find problems that
you do not want to repeat.</p>
<p>Speaking is vital at decision points in your career progress - at
interviews, competitions, gaining new collaborators at conferences,
impressing peers/boss/subordinates. Thus, it’s best not to make these
mistakes in those situations.</p>
<p>Aspects to a presentation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>speaker: appearance, verbal accent, enunciation, smell</p></li>
<li><p>slides: layout, content</p></li>
<li><p>audience: background</p></li>
<li><p>venue: size, technology available, lighting</p></li>
<li><p>lead time: how much time do you have to prepare?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following list is meant to be reviewed as a checklist.</p>
<p>Planning your presentation</p>
<p>In introducing your research, there are a few ways to open the
talk</p>
<ul>
<li><p>compliment the audience</p></li>
<li><p>humor: relevant joke</p></li>
<li><p>how does this work make me feel</p></li>
<li><p>explain context and relevance in terms of money, number of people
involved, size of system</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Estimate the experience/education background of your audience prior
to creating the presentation. The question being answered in the
presentation is independent of audience, but the level of delivery
depends on audience background.</p>
<p>Speaking to an audience outside your field:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use jargon your audience is familiar with. For example, a
physicist uses "quantization of energy" whereas an audience of
mathematicians may be more comfortable with "discrete energy
levels."</p></li>
<li><p>Look for commonality. For example, both physicists and
mathematicians use assumptions and build models.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Visual presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Switching between dark and light slides in a dark room stresses
the eyes (need time to adjust to varying light levels)</p></li>
<li><p>In figures, use both color contrast and distinct symbols, in
order to deal with colorblind audiences. See also
http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/</p></li>
<li><p>making slides appear "professional" means adding
non-informational content. This added content should be consistent, not
distracting</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Software: Common choices include Latex (beamer), Microsoft
Powerpoint. Less well-known are Prezi (and its open source equivalent,
InkScape+Sozi add-on).</p>
<p>If you use Microsoft Word, a document PDF, notepad, or any other
non-presentation software to make a presentation, then you are sending a
few messages to your audience: The audience isn’t worth your time needed
to develop or learn a proper presentation You are not technically
savvy</p>
<p>Presenting multiple topics within one presentation: Disparate topics
require a segue to show why you are transitioning Inter-relate the
multiple topics Dealing with technical failure If you plan to give a
live demo, have screenshots of the process in the presentation. That
way, if the demo fails you can show what was supposed to happen in the
slides. If the demo works, skip the slides. If possible, use the setup
as close to reality as possible for practice sessions. Project onto the
screen using the projector. This will show if the color contrast is
sufficient.</p>
<p>Prior to giving a talk at a remote (or unfamiliar) environment</p>
<p>Questions to ask your host:</p>
<p>Will I have a projector and screen for the presentation?</p>
<p>If Power point available, what version is in use?</p>
<p>Will I be allowed to bring a USB drive and/or laptop into the
location (security restrictions), or should I email the pptx file to
you?</p>
<p>Day of talk</p>
<p>Appearance (suit and tie or jeans and t-shirt?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>under-dressed = I don’t respect the audience</p></li>
<li><p>overdressed = I’m better than you</p></li>
<li><p>similar level of dress = I’m a peer</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these suggestions may seem glaringly obvious. The reason they
are here is because I have personally seen them in "official"
presentations given by a "professional"</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do not curse (profanity while speaking, or in the slide
presentation, or even the name of the file)</p></li>
<li><p>Practice the presentation (out loud in real time) at least
once</p></li>
<li><p>Run spell check before presenting</p></li>
<li><p>Translate your slides from your native language to the language
of your audience</p></li>
<li><p>Tell a coherent story with a unified theme. Each slide should be
logically connected to the following slide. Don’t just put a bunch of
slides with data together. You risk disorienting your audience.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Before the talk begins</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure your facility has power, a screen, a projector,
pointer, any other necessary equipment. [Your host may not think of
these things for you.]</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure all equipment works and functions together</p></li>
<li><p>Before the presentation begins, use a slide to make announcements
and reminders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>list agenda if there are multiple speakers</p></li>
<li><p>time talk begins, how long it will last</p></li>
<li><p>Reminder: Turn OFF Cell Phones</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Announce whether to ask questions during talk (interrupt) or to
hold questions until done</p></li>
</ul>
<p>During the talk</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Opening: Thank hosts/inviters/organizers. Establish a connection
between you (the speaker) and the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not pace</p></li>
<li><p>Do not stand frozen</p></li>
<li><p>If you are the only person laughing at your joke, it isn’t
funny</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After the talk</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let the person asking the question finish</p></li>
<li><p>Restate the question to ensure the audience heard it and that you
understood it</p></li>
<li><p>Give the minimal answer. Save the long answer for
followup</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time compared to
theft</h3>
<p>Source: <span class="citation" data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove
1995)</span>.</p>
<p>In large organizations, there can be significant bureaucracy
associated with even small purchases. A multi-step review process may be
incurred for a $2000 acquisition.</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>Those metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people’s time.
Consider a meeting of 10 people and each person’s cost is $200 per hour.
A wasted meeting is not unusual and certainly would not incur
bureaucratic review processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally
the same – $2000. Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes
a loss of productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth
of time is not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In fact, organizations default to meetings (even recurring meetings)
rather than not meet. And being late to a meeting is accepted.</p>
<p>We can debate the differences between theft of materials and theft of
time. The financial argument is clear.</p>
<h3 id="does-anyone-want-to-volunteer">Does anyone want to
volunteer?</h3>
<p>Meeting facilitator asking, "Does anyone want to volunteer for this
task?" to a group will most often be met by silence. The lack of
engagement can be addressed by not asking for volunteers. The outcome
can be higher engagement with the following tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask each person whether they are attending to observe or to
volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person how much time they are willing to volunteer.
Responses could be 0, or 1 hour (non-recurring), or 1 hour per month, or
something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what their goals in the interaction are. It is
usually generic ("I want the group to succeed.") but it can be narrow,
in which case that gives you something to focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what they are good at and what skills they have.
Are they good with personal interaction? Writing? Computers?
Coordinating? Logistics? Fund raising? Making phone calls?</p></li>
<li><p>From the inventory of tasks, are there any that fit both the
skills and time? Can the task be scoped to fit the time? If there are
multiple candidate tasks for a volunteer, let them pick the task. (If
there is no existing task that aligns with their skills, do not create
work to be assigned.)</p></li>
<li><p>If there are other volunteer working the same tasks, put them in
contact with the other participants</p></li>
<li><p>Give the volunteer a deadline for the task. The deadline should
not be arbitrary – the deadline should be based on the dependent
follow-on tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the volunteer is willing to commit the time to
complete the tasks by the deadline</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a check-in with the volunteer before the task deadline
to review progress</p></li>
<li><p>To create accountability among multiple volunteers, hold a group
review to explain how each participant’s work contributes to the goals
and how work done by one person enables the next task done by someone
else. (Enumerate the dependency graph; include deadlines.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Meeting types: scheduled one-on-ones, impromptu walk-around,
conferences.</p>
<h3 id="one-on-one-check-in-meetings">One-on-one check-in meetings</h3>
<p>One-on-one meeting questions for helping the manager understand the
team member’s status.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what are the objectives for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>what have you been successful with since we last met?</p></li>
<li><p>what is blocking our team’s progress?</p></li>
<li><p>what are your plans?</p></li>
<li><p>how are you collaborating with the rest of the team?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reflective prompts for one-on-one meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there was just one thing you could change about our
organization, what would it be and why?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan to train your coworkers on topics you understand
and they don’t?</p></li>
<li><p>What have you learned in the past month?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the biggest risks for the team?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s limiting your productivity?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Responding to these questions takes time (an hour) and willingness to
be open.</p>
<p> <br />
The one-on-one check-in should be tailored to the phase of the
employee’s progression.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>new team member, either new to the team or new to the company.
Here the focus of the one-on-one is to ensure a smooth on-boarding
process. Does the employee have the necessary computer log-in accounts?
Do they have an email account? Are they on the mailing list?<br />
<em>The duration of this phase could last between a day and two
weeks.</em></p></li>
<li><p>team member is responsible for small tasks: the one-one-one is
for discussions on training and sprint planning and sprint-reviews.
Characterized by the team member being dependent on others for their
success. In this phase the employee collaborates on tasks. <em>The
duration of this phase could last a few months to years.</em></p></li>
<li><p>team member is responsible for large tasks (which get broken into
subtasks): the one-on-one is to help the team member define their
success. Activities include planning, resource allocation, assessment.
Characterized by the need to coordinate with others on the team or other
teams. <em>The duration of this phase could could be the rest of a
career.</em></p></li>
<li><p>facilitating the productivity of others: rather than being
task-oriented, this team member supports coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p>peer check-in: this one-on-one is a form of mentorship. The value
of the exchange is to get a different perspective and to hold each other
accountable.</p></li>

<h3 id="how-to-be-a-successful-conference-attendee">How to be a
Successful Conference Attendee</h3>
<p><strong>Before the conference</strong><br />
Determine the date of the conference. Does it conflict with other events
in your schedule?</p>
<p>How will attending the conference benefit your progress? Social
interaction, presenting your ideas.</p>
<p>Submit your abstract for review prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>Apply for travel grant funding as needed. Look to the sponsoring
organization, conference website, and your own host institution.</p>
<p>Find housing nearby the conference location. Find a roommate.</p>
<p>Book a flight/transportation. Plan to arrive at least a day before
you are scheduled to speak. (Speaking on the day you arrive is tiring.)
Flights on Monday and Friday are often more expensive than mid week.
Cheapest flights are released on Tuesday. [link]</p>
<p>Coordinate someone to cover for you while you are gone.</p>
<p>Find out who else is attending the conference. Which talks look
interesting. If there are people you know, let them know you are coming
and would like to see them.</p>
<p>Start stalking attendee profiles. If it is a small conference/summer
school, get a list of attendees and learn their names/interests.</p>
<p>Bring printed papers, CV, business cards. Distribute these at the
career fair, your talk. Bring an night shade and ear plugs. Your
roommate may snore.</p>
<p><strong>How to determine which sessions to attend</strong><br />
For very large conferences, the scope is broader so there will be a lot
of content outside your field. This means if you go to short talks, they
will be hard to understand since they are very focused. Therefore attend
the invited and plenary talks (usually at the beginning of the week)
even if they are outside your field. They will be at a more accessible
level, helping to determine which subfields may be of interest.</p>
<p>Start socializing on the plane, in the airport. This is warmup for
the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Upon arrival</strong><br />
Register. Get map, current conference schedule.</p>
<p>Socialize as much as possible. This is the point of a conference.
Talk to people in line, before and after talks, at meals, at the hotel.
Advantages over a regular stranger are that (1) there is a common topic
to discuss (other than the weather), (2) they are probably also
interested in that common topic. Also discuss meta-topics – how the talk
went visually/audio, how the conference is being run. Both parties are
probably out of their home environment/city, so that is another
commonality.</p>
<p>Keep all receipts for purchases. Keep your airline boarding
passes.</p>
<p>Write down interesting ideas that are triggered by conversations
outside your specialty.</p>
<p><strong>After your return</strong><br />
Send emails to people you spoke with/got business cards. "Thanks for
talking with me about X at the Y conference last week." For recruiters,
"Thanks for talking with me about positions X at the Y conference last
week. Attached is a copy of my curriculum vitae. Please contact me to
schedule an interview."</p>

and business cards.</p></li>
<li><p>"Think, pair, share." Give participants a scenario or question to
think about. Then break into small groups (2 to 5) to discuss the topic.
Finally, have groups share their results with other groups. Sets of
groups can have different topic. For example, 30 people split into
groups of 5, with three scenarios to discuss (two groups per scenario).
If a problem is able to be broken into 3 parts (i.e., theory,
experiment, marketing), then each set of two groups can work on a
different part.</p></li>

<p>It is possible to operate within a bureaucracy and entirely focus on

role of engaging with other people – peer bureaucrats, supervisors, and
subjects. In this book a third option of accounting for emergent
phenomena has been argued for.</p>
<p>Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn’t mean you can ignore
personalities of individuals. Bureaucracy as a skill is in addition to
being a good person, being an effective member of a team, being a good
project manager, having technical skills, etc.</p>

<p>An view from inside bureaucracy as a <a

<p>Central claims:</p>

<li><p>Everyone in modern society participates in bureaucracy. Therefore
becoming skilled is useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals already have experience with bureaucracy from
conventional roles in modern society.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergent behavior and being a wicked problem make the complexity
of bureaucracy irreducible to a simplistic model.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucracy requires</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sufficient scale because it is an emergent phenomenon for
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making.</p></li>
<li><p>lack of common quantitative feedback mechanism for
individuals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The techniques of bureaucracy are what lead to emergence at
scale: meetings, processes, communication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The consequence of thinking like a bureaucrat is that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>effects of bureaucracy are not the fault of one person, but each
person can improve bureaucracy</p></li>
<li><p>you are not limited to only the direct personal interactions that
you have with other people. Framing allows you to think about processes

<li><p>Help you recognize options beyond the naive defaults associated

<h2 id="audience-analysis">Audience Analysis</h2>
<p>Primary audience for this book is self-identified novice bureaucrats
and people planning to work in a bureaucracy. Value of this book is
advice beyond “be a good person” and specific to the role of a
bureaucrat (and not project manager/team lead/software developer).</p>
<p>Secondary audience is white collar workers who have experience
working in a bureaucracy and are just realizing they are bureaucrats.
This audience will find some of the information to be already known.</p>
<p>Tertiary audience is non-bureaucrats who want to better understand
why bureaucratic systems are challenging. Americans consider themselves
"individuals" and neglect the necessary integration of operating within
a society. This book won’t be a popular best seller, but it is intended
for a lay audience and does not assume prior academic exposure to the
topic.</p>
<p>Lastly, researchers of bureaucracy. This book is not a theoretical
systemic analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This encyclopedic reference/text provides an analysis of the basic
issues and major aspects of bureaucracy, bureaucratic politics and
administrative theory, public policy, and public administration in
historical and contemporary perspectives. Examining theoretical,
philosophical, and empirical interpretations, as well as the intricate
position of bureaucracy in government, politics, national development,
international relations, and a host of other institutions, the book
focuses on the multifunctional role of public bureaucracies in societies
with various socioeconomic, political, cultural, and ideological
orientations and covers a wide range of processes and subjects.<a

author’s assessment: written by an anthropologist; gives an outsider’s
view and the experiences of a subject of bureaucrats. Introduction gives
a good history of modern bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is comprised of an introduction, three chapters, and an
Appendix.</p>
<p>In the introduction Graeber proposes his “Iron Law of
Liberalism”,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any market reform, any government initiative intended to reduce red
tape and promote market forces will have the ultimate effect of
increasing the total number of regulations, the total amount of
paperwork, and the total number of bureaucrats the government
employs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graeber claims working-class Americans see government as comprised of
politicians and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The options for decision making are bureaucracy and the market.</p>

author’s assessment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Street-level bureaucracy concerns a vital part of the ways in which
public policy programs are implemented, particularly through the
relationship between public officials and individual citizens.
Addressing the state of the art and providing a systematic exploration
of the theoretical and methodological issues at stake, this Research
Handbook is a crucial contribution to the analysis of public policy from
the perspective of the ground floor of government.</p>
<p>The Research Handbook covers theoretical themes in current research
such as institutional theory, social inequality, national culture,
discrimination and representation, digitalization, and accountability.
Analysing the role of teachers, police officers and other street-level
bureaucrats, chapters explore how these individuals implement policies
through their daily contact with citizens. Further sections investigate
the methodological tools for research, as well as the future challenges
facing the area. Peter Hupe concludes with lessons for the study of
street-level bureaucracy and a significant research agenda for the
topic.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"

<p>Intended audience: novice bureaucrats starts their public service
career</p>
<p>author has read this book: yes<br />

author’s assessment: terrible; avoid this book!</p>
<p>As a government bureaucrat, I wanted to see if this book could be
useful for helping new members of my organization. This book is not
appropriate for that use, and the book contains bad advice. Some of the
views are harmful.</p>
<p>In a paragraph about communicating with the public on page 51, the
author provides a racist observation: "If the person you are talking to
is Asian, and they are nodding when they say yes, assume they don’t have
the slightest idea of what you’re saying, but are too polite to tell
you."</p>
<p>In the chapter on education, on page 12 the author’s advice is, "To
be a good bureaucrat you should become computer literate, as opposed to
becoming computer stupid. This is true for any career field you choose.
Almost all job applications are submitted on the computer. Office
E-Mails have replaced typed memorandums."</p>
<p>This book was published in 2015, so this content is jarring from the
perspective of 2022. I suspect part of the cause is that author is old;
the author bio mentions a 48 year career, which means he was probably 70
at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Setting aside the bad advice and harm in this book, the author’s view
is that a bureaucrat is a government employee. The author advocates
working in Human Resources or a budget office since those are stable
jobs. The book does contain some valid observations about life as a
bureaucrat; however, the valid insights are outweighed by the number and
importance of incorrect explanations.</p>
<p>The book appears to based wholly on the author’s experience. No
citations to research and no surveys are mentioned. Only two other
publications are cited (Webster’s dictionary for definitions, and the
book "Rules for Radicals"). The advice is written to be generic to
modern (American) bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The book is self-published. There are a few minor errors (missing
periods, extra periods) but not so many as to be disruptive to reading
the content.</p>
