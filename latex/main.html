<p>this is the dedication</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>I wrote this book for me. I knew I didn’t know much when I first
started my job in a large organization. I learned from my mistakes by
reflecting on my (in)actions and consequences. That has been an
expensive education; mistakes delay progress and damage
relationships.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about bureaucracies, or you
are thinking about working as a bureaucrat, or you are employed as a
bureaucrat, or your job is shifting to be more bureaucratic.</p>
<p>This is not a book on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, or self-improvement.</p>
<p>Better able to recognize and navigate complex environments, both in
your career and outside of work. This perspective can benefit you
whether by promotion of title or increase in pay; successful completion
of a project; decreased stress of understanding how the world works.</p>
<p>My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the
observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint
hard.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research. While this material is intended to be timeless and generic, it
is culturally specific to the USA. As a privileged white male, I did not
encounter systemic hurdles in my career.</p>
<p>This material is based on personal experience, reading published
materials, and anecdotes from other people.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is feasible. Each section is intended
to be stand-alone. The book is intended to spark contemplation.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-bureaucracy">Introduction to Bureaucracy</h1>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is bureaucracy?</h3>
<p>While you may know it when you see it or experience it, for this book
a definition is useful. <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is coordination of
stakeholders. This concept is most visible for complex, long lasting,
and recurring situations involving many people. The apparent friction
can be lower when there are only a few people involved ("I’m just
talking to my collaborator"), but there is a continuous gradient.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-bureaucracy-exist-cant-we-just-do-the-work">Why does
bureaucracy exist? Can’t we just do the work?</h3>
<p>The minimal scenario to start from is to imagine a single person
working on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is
relatively easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does
not recur. Most of what you do occurs outside those limits and thus
incurs some concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks where order of the subtasks
matters.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of roles</h3>
<h3 id="org-chart-as-a-guide-and-a-lie">Org chart as a guide and a
lie</h3>
<p>lie in the sense that undocumented relationships matter more than the
roles</p>
<p>lie in the sense of orientation; see <a href="#org-chart-orientation"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org-chart-orientation">[org-chart-orientation]</a></p>
<h3 id="approval-process">Approval process</h3>
<h3 id="meetings-for-coordination">Meetings for coordination</h3>
<p>coordination and signaling</p>
<h3 id="written-communication">Written communication</h3>
<p>Reports, memos, emails are artifacts of bureaucracy. They create
evidence and can be used for good or bad.</p>
<h1 id="bureaucracies-are-made-of-humans">Bureaucracies are made of
Humans</h1>
<p><span id="org-chart-orientation"
label="org-chart-orientation"></span> A common method of describing
relations within the bureaucracy is the organization chart
(colloquially, the "org chart"). Normally the CEO is at the top of the
chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed employees are at
the bottom.</p>
<p>There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CEO at the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>CEO on the left</p></li>
<li><p>CEO on the right</p></li>
<li><p>CEO as the center of a star</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Social interaction example: "Did you see the game on TV last
night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting tickets
for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucratic interaction example: "You’ll need to get approval
from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their review. Then
talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>To make invisible work and invisible bureaucracy visible, document
the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s "culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social/visible bureaucracy/invisible bureaucracy is a characterization
of the culture. There are norms associated with each of these three
categories.</p>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no bureaucracy, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information. Then the management
process of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (money, staffing) and no need to fight over
direction.</p>
<p>While that ideal scenario is not going to happen, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each person has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>each person applies the same decision making process
consistently</p></li>
<li><p>every person has the same incentives</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is inefficient is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not everyone has the same information</p></li>
<li><p>processes are inconsistent</p></li>
<li><p>incentives vary</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add the issue that each person’s reference experiences are
unique. As a consequence, decision making is subjective.</p>
<p>Can any action be taken to improve bureaucratic efficiency? Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you can share information with other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can seek information from other stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you can strive for and demonstrate transparency</p></li>
<li><p>apply consistent processes</p></li>
<li><p>hold others (and yourself) accountable</p></li>
<li><p>account for varying incentives and reference experiences</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Laffer curve is a claim in economics that there is a relation
between government tax rates and the revenue from taxes collected. The
relation, based on Rolle’s theorem, says that between a tax rate of
0</p>
<p>While the mathematical statement may be provable, the use in
economics seems hand-wavy. In this post, I’ll extend that hand-waviness
to a different domain: bureaucratic processes in organizations. The
relation to the Laffer curve is that bureaucratic processes a tax on
productivity.</p>
