<p>Thank you to my coworkers. Our interactions me learn how to be a
better bureaucrat.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="foreword">Foreword</h1>
<p>If you have a negative impression of bureaucracy, I want to convince
you that bureaucracy is vital and that you can learn to skillfully
navigate bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I see this struggle of bureaucracy as critical to modern society. The
challenge of bureaucracy is widespread across a variety of governments
in different societies, and bureaucracy is durable – it has existed for
hundreds if not thousands of years. Therefore, tackling the challenge of
bureaucracy is exciting for me. I enjoy pondering hard problems and then
leveraging insights gained from reflection. Being an effective
bureaucrat is important to me because bureaucracy can be a force
multiplier beyond what I could accomplish on my own.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, or you are thinking about how to productively contribute to
society, or you want impactful employment, or your job is not what you
expected. If you’re wondering why innovation is hard within a
bureaucratic organization, this guidebook is intended to help understand
what the challenges are.</p>
<p>Everyone in modern society is a participant in bureaucracy. The
purpose of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and
better arm you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a
bureaucrat. With focused reflection and a good guidebook, you can
improve your skills as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>This book is neither a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to
disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, the intent
of this book is to serve as a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, or self-improvement. However, in the process of being a better
bureaucrat some lessons may apply in those domains.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t address personal stress caused by bureaucracy, how
to decrease stress, or how to balance the activities of work and
life-outside-work.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t focus on citizens, Congress (state or federal), or
competing organizations.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t address discrimination or harassment. This book
doesn’t address bad coworkers, abusive bosses, psychological defects of
individuals, or malicious intent. Issues like lying, bribery, and
criminal behavior are not discussed. All these aspects happen whenever
people interact; the challenges are not specific to bureaucracy. In this
book I assume you are honest, and that other people are honest. Even
with this simplifying assumption the complexities of bureaucracy arise.
In the context of that benign bureaucracy, guidance on how to be an
effective bureaucrat is provided.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex professional environments, both within
your career and outside of work. The perspectives offered in this book
can benefit you directly, whether by promotion of title, increase in
pay, successful completion of a project, or through decreased stress of
understanding how the world operates. Being a more effective bureaucrat
can also positive impact the causes you care about and the people you
engage with.</p>
<p>If you do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, you won’t know what
is your own fault, the fault of your coworkers, the fault of management,
and what is intrinsic to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>If you do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, you’re less likely
to be successful interacting with those around you. The self-recognition
of being a bureaucrat matters; how you behave and what you think your
responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle in the face of
complex large-scale systems. Thinking about complex large-scale systems
is not part of the education curriculum. This book will help you learn
about bureaucracy and lead to an increase of your ability to identify
patterns and apply relevant techniques.</p>
<p>Everyone is a bureaucrat because there are no alternatives to
bureaucracy for a society. Gaining skills in navigating bureaucracy are
helpful both for your own happiness and the well-being of a functioning
society.</p>
<p>Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is
not helpful. Automation and computers merely obfuscate processes and
make negotiation more challenging.</p>
<p>Simplifying interactions with other people to “this is characterized
merely as human relations" is an easier perspective compared to
considering bureaucracy as a complex system. However, a simplified view
either misses emergent phenomena or mischaracterizes the situation. In
either case, your effectiveness is harmed.</p>
<p>When I first started my job in a large organization I recognized
differences between the expectations of the education system I had left
and the challenges of a professional environment. Over the years I
learned from my mistakes by reflecting on my (in)actions and the
consequences. This approach has been an expensive education. My mistakes
delayed progress and damaged relationships. The motive in this book is
to provide generalizations from my experiences which might benefit the
reader.</p>
<p>In my reflections and attempting to draw lessons there is a risk of
overanalysis. Sometimes a situation is merely happenstance, and
sometimes attempting to extract lessons from randomness is folly.
Avoiding conjecture about conspiracy and malice is a fuzzy boundary when
insufficient information is available.</p>
<p>My experiences cannot be generalized to every situation. Some of the
observations here may be analogous to your context if you squint.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research or policy development. While this material is intended to be
timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the United States of
America in the early twenty first century. There are cultural blindspots
not addressed in this book because I did not encounter systemic hurdles
in my career as financially privileged white male.</p>
<p>This material is based on personal experience, reading published
materials, and anecdotes from other people. No surveys were taken to
support the claims made. No double blind experiments were conducted.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is the default option. The essentials
of bureaucracy described in § <a href="#fundamentals_of_b"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fundamentals_of_b">[fundamentals_of_b]</a> will be
familiar to experienced bureaucrats. Each section in Chapter <a
href="#b_made_of_humans" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="b_made_of_humans">[b_made_of_humans]</a> is intended to
be able to be read stand-alone. The content is intended to spark
contemplation.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-to-bureaucracy">Introduction to Bureaucracy</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is bureaucracy?<span
id="sec:define_bureaucracy" label="sec:define_bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy is the specialization of roles necessitated by scaling
and complexity for the distribution of common resources or widespread
policy</p>
<p>In the course of carrying out someone else’s subjectively defined
policy, you have to make your own subjective decisions in the execution
and enforcement in the course of carrying out someone else’s
subjectively defined policy, you have to make your own subjective
decisions in the execution and enforcement</p>
<p>While you may know it when you see it or experience it, for this book
definitions are useful. There are three distinct roles in bureaucracy:
policy creator, policy enforcer, and the person upon whom policy is
inflicted.</p>
<p>The existence of bureaucracy is independent of an organization’s
purpose.</p>
<p>The policy creator is either a politician or a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> is a person
subjectively interpreting policies on behalf of an organization and has
discretionary enforcement to facilitate coordination of
stakeholders.</p>
<p>Let’s break that down piece-by-piece. First, “subjective
interpretation” means there is a person making a decision about how to
do something. The subjectivity arises from different reasons one might
choose an option over a competing option. “Policies" is a set of actions
in a given circumstance. “An <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span>" is the
collection of people for who the policy is made. “Discretionary
enforcement” means the person is choosing how to apply the policy in the
specific circumstances. “Facilitating coordination” means bureaucracy is
about getting multiple people (or sometimes a person at different
instances in time) to work together. The “stakeholders” is a group of
people who care about the application of the action in each
circumstance. That’s still pretty dense, so the rest of the book is
spent expanding on the nuances and implications of this definition.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, or any specific institution (corporations, governments,
academics). Bureaucracy is not defined to be efficient nor, does it have
to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not restricted to paperwork, or record
keeping, or quantification, or gathering metrics.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision
making, coordination, and processes. Involves negotiation, primarily
informal.</p>
<p>An organization comprised of bureaucrats is a <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>. The definition of
bureaucracy used in this book is independent of government. Nothing in
this definition involves paperwork or an office building. Definitions
that limit the concept of bureaucracy to specific contexts result in a
decreased ability to describe complex large-scale human
organizations.</p>
<p>The protagonist within a <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is the <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> – the person who is
a member of an organization and is responsible for subjective
implementation of policy for the organization. The person that a
bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on a <span
data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. Depending on context,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a police officer or
government official. Sometimes a bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on
other bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policy for embassy employees.</p>
<p>A critical aspect of bureaucracy is that everything is made up,
specifically by other humans. The consequence is that everything is
negotiable. You (in the role of either a subject or a bureaucrat) need
to know who to negotiate with and how to negotiate the desired changes.
The only actual rules are mathematical physics that describe nature.
Everything else is either naturally occurring macroscopic emergent
phenomena (e.g., chemistry, biology) or humans making up labels and
norms.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises when there is no common objectively quantifiable
feedback mechanism for individual participants in the organization. This
aspect is why governments, schools, and prisons are characterized as
bureaucratic. The military doesn’t rank soldiers by “number of enemies
killed” and is bureaucratic. Even profit-driven commercial organizations
are bureaucratic when the impacts of individual employees are not
coupled to sales metrics.</p>
<p>Profit-based feedback makes some roles in a business context slightly
more predictable and understandable, though there are still trade-offs
like long-term profit versus short-term profit and externalization of
harm.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex, long lasting,
and recurring situations involving many people. The apparent friction
can be lower when there are only a few people involved (“I’m just
talking to my collaborator" or “I’m just buying groceries from a clerk
at the store” or “I’m using a website for a government service”), but
there is a continuous gradient.</p>
<p>There is the external resource (mail delivery for USPS, public safety
for FBI, environment for EPA) and there are resources internal to the
bureaucracy. The focus of this book is on internal resources. In that
context, bureaucracy is for the disseminated responsibility for use of
resources: attention, skill, expertise. Time, money, staffing are proxy
measures.</p>
<p>A useful way to think about bureaucracy is as a system for
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making. That is in
contrast to easier-to-understand concepts like centralized knowledge and
centralized decision making. A government run by dictatorship is easy to
conceptualize compared to democracies because there is a central
character around which a narrative can be formed. Similarly, telling
stories about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> of
a company is much easier than capturing the thousands of interactions
conducted by the many employees of that company. Linear story-telling
with a small number of protagonists does not map well to the
complexities of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Distributed knowledge and distributed decision making are hindered
by</p>
<ul>
<li><p>limited bandwidth between people, specifically the bureaucrats
involved</p></li>
<li><p>non-zero latency of information between people, specifically the
bureaucrats involved</p></li>
<li><p>the cost of measurement (getting data)</p></li>
<li><p>the cost of analysis of the data</p></li>
<li><p>making decisions that are suboptimal</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="views-of-bureaucracy-within-a-bureaucratic-organization">Views
of bureaucracy within a bureaucratic organization<span
id="sec:alternative_views_from_within"
label="sec:alternative_views_from_within"></span></h3>
<p>Bureaucracy as I have defined it in §<a
href="#sec:define_bureaucracy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:define_bureaucracy">[sec:define_bureaucracy]</a> is
not the only way that bureaucrats perceive their environment.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats typically focus on themselves, their work, their
subjects, their coworkers, their superiors, and their subordinates. In
that context, the motives for activities varies. If your request costs
me additional work and there’s no deadline and there’s no reward, what
is my incentive? Emotional approval? Relationship building? social
approval?</p>
<p>The perspectives below are archetypical for bureaucrats who don’t
consider bureaucy as defined in §<a href="#sec:define_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:define_bureaucracy">[sec:define_bureaucracy]</a>; an
individual’s perspective might be a mixture of these views.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is what I can accomplish with my
skills and the resources I have access to.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This person is task oriented. Results are what
matters. The intricacies of bureaucracy are a distraction to getting the
work done. Communication as a distraction from work of the individual.
May have the perception that if they initiate formation of a community,
they will be blamed when things go wrong. The emotional reward for this
person is accomplishment of the task. This person is likely to say to
their manager, "Tell me what I need to do to be successful" rather than
identify collaborations.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is how I feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your feelings are real. They have consequence, in
that your emotions impact motivation and enthusiasm. However, a
feelings-centric perspective may not be productive for you or your team
or the organization. Balancing those competing needs is challenging.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>What matters is how others feel.</strong><br />
Depending on the emotional state of those around you is unhealthy and
can be unproductive. Working for the happiness or satisfaction of other
people is risky – they may not know what’s best, or they may not have
your interests in mind.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>What matters is my immediate coworkers.</strong><br />
In this scenario everything else is personified or ignored. This can be
positive (I collaborate with those around me) or negative (I am in
competition with those around me).<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your do relationships matter. However, they are not
all that matters. Being able to explain what is happening outside the
immediately observable realm is what is missing from this view.</p>
<h2 id="models-of-bureaucracy">Models of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Commercial businesses have a different accountability – money. Common
across all participants within the organization, and common with
external stakeholders. The goal of a company is to generate profit.
Commercial businesses have people who make subjective decisions and
enforce policies, but there is a common metric for feedback. The
feedback mechanism is not perfect. Being a good commercial bureaucrat
does not necessarily result in monetary success.</p>
<p>Prisons, schools, medical, government, military all consume and spend
money, but money isn’t the goal. When faced with a decision, choice is
not guided by which will generate more profit.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy resists characterization. Bureaucracy is worse than
emergent - the system rules can be altered or ignored by the
stakeholders. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">Wicked problem</a>.
This is why coming up with a holistic theory of bureaucracy is
difficult.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne
effect</a></p>
<p>As soon as a claim is made, then a group can respond to that claim by
behaving in an opposing manner.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-as-a-machine">Bureaucracy as a Machine</h3>
<p><strong>Bureaucracy is a machine that has throughput and latency and
dependencies and mechanisms. Bureaucrats are cogs in that
machine</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Complex large scale interlocking
processes. <em>What this is missing</em>: Perceiving yourself as a cog
in the wheel means a loss of agency</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-as-an-economic-model">Bureaucracy as an Economic
model</h3>
<h4 id="a-collection-of-rational-actors">A collection of Rational
actors</h4>
<p>Individuals cooperate to promote their own self-interests.
Individuals compete to promote their own self-interests. Individuals
enforce social consensus to promote their own self-interests.
Individuals cheat/lie/break social norms to promote their own
self-interests.</p>
<h4 id="firms">Firms</h4>
<p>Firms exist in a market because negotiating contracts and prices for
every interaction is burdensome.</p>
<p>Doesn’t address small vs large companies, and doesn’t distinguish
between profit-oriented and non-profit and government.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-as-emergent-phenomenon">Bureaucracy as Emergent
phenomenon</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy as a set of many bilateral interactions may not need to
invoke emergence. However, there’s a universality that hints at
emergence.</p>
<p>Above the threshold for emergence, there is scale-free behavior. The
same patterns are observable at large organizations and extremely large
organizations.</p>
<p>All those choices faced by the individual are not independent choices
with respect to other bureaucrats in their environment. There is a
flocking behavior of my choices are informed by the choices of those
around me. Not necessarily in space.</p>
<p>Everyone is playing by different rules and has different objectives
and everything is dynamic (both individuals and the conditions).</p>
<p>Bureaucracy as a macroscopic phenomenon is emergent at sufficient
scale. The scale is important because there is no longer dependence on
individual relationships (beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>). There are people in the organization that you don’t know
and for which there is no common accountability. An organization
subdivided into team recursively until there is local person-to-person
accountability.</p>
<p>The local rules bureaucrats employ to enable distributed decisions
using distributed knowledge is meetings, processes, and
communications.</p>
<p>The relevance of making a claim that something is emergent is that
there is behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale, and Knowing that
individual motives and actions of every player at the microscopic level
is not relevant.</p>
<p>What does “emergent” mean? Nominal emergence example: a circle is
emergent from a collection of points. Weak emergence is measurable using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality">Granger
causality</a> or, equivalently<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy">transfer
entropy</a> (information theory).</p>
<p>A colloquial interpretation of emergent behavior from complex
phenomona is treating the system as an entity – personification. See
<span class="citation" data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall 2002)</span>
<em>What this is missing</em>: The problem with treating an org as
entity is that apparent behavior is counter-intuitive. But when you
break it into individual people their motives make more sense. This
merely improve the post hoc rationalization.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-in-game-theory">Bureaucracy in Game Theory</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy does not fit cleanly into game theory categories of
cooperative or competitive.</p>
<p>Maybe all the interactions within a bureaucracy are a bunch of small
games?</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is self-modifying.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is in constant flux due to external conditions,
externally imposed constraints, staff turn-over, internal dilemmas,
disagreements of individuals.</p>

<p>Perception: Organizations are composed of individuals with
personalities, and the inefficiency is attributable to a mashing
together of distinct individuals with conflicting desires. While this is
true, it isn’t complete.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Other aspects like history of the
processes (legacy) and protection against malicious subjects and
protection against malicious bureaucrats. Analysis that stops at
personalities misses emergent phenomena. Analysis that stops at
personalities of individuals typically explains larger scale phenomena
using personification of teams and organizations.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy<span
id="fundamentals_of_b" label="fundamentals_of_b"></span></h2>
<p>This section provides terminology and definition for a bureaucratic
lens. Specifically bureaucracy is defined and labels for roles in
bureaucracy are named. Structure in organizations is often characterized
by hierarchy, and that hierarchy is described by an “organization
chart.” Lastly, meetings and written communication are the way in which
consensus among bureaucrats is established.</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of Roles</h3>
<p>A major feature of bureaucracy is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">structure
of the organization</a> for which policies are created and carried out.
Structure in an organization is dynamic, but at any point in time an
organization typically has a defined set of roles. Those roles have
different scopes of decision authority.</p>
<p>Roles in an organization are defined by the boundaries of
responsibility. The purpose of a role is to minimize conflict and reduce
redundancy, allowing regularity and control. Clear responsibility
enables effective bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The choices in a hierarchy are 1) a supervisor oversees how many
people and 2) a person has how many supervisors. Naively one might
expect that an employee has one boss, but that is not a requirement. The
more people a supervisor oversees, the flatter the organization. See
<span class="citation" data-cites="2012_Valve">(unknown 2012)</span> and
<span class="citation" data-cites="1972_Joreen">(Joreen
1972)</span>.</p>
<p>The consequence of hierarchy in an organization means that as a
member of the bureaucracy you do not have full autonomy – otherwise you
would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time you are not
under strict control of the organization – you still have some
subjective decision making authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. Some autonomy is retained by all members of
the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Independent of defined roles and designated titles in an
organization’s hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a
separate social hierarchy of informal influencers and decision makers.
Informal influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships
with the decision maker or relevant credentials or both. The credentials
can be formal (e.g., a PhD) or informal (demonstrated success on a
project). In either case, the decision maker is relying on another
person’s expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relations within an organization is mentors
and mentees. These relations allow mentors to transmit institutional
knowledge to mentees, and allows people in senior positions to access
the novice perspective.</p>
<p> <br />
One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people because they think they are disempowered. A
person, Sue, is perceived to have power over another person, Amy,
because Amy gave up some control to Sue. Amy not having control creates
fear, regardless of how Sue behaves.</p>
<h3 id="organizational-chart-as-a-guide-and-a-lie">Organizational chart
as a guide and a lie</h3>
<p>An <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart">organizational
chart</a> (hereafter “org chart”) identifies roles and the relations
among roles. An org chart is at best a snapshot in time, and more often
aspirational than descriptive. In spite of possible deficiencies, an org
chart helps outsiders and newcomers understand the scope of
responsibilities and interactions.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Org charts are a lie in the sense that undocumented relationships can
matter more than the official roles. Org charts fail to capture the
informal roles and network of relations that facilitate progress in any
organization.</p>
<p>Org charts foster a lie by creating sense power dynamics based on
visual orientation. For more on this issue see § <a
href="#org-chart-orientation" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org-chart-orientation">[org-chart-orientation]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="not-many-options-for-organizations">Not many options for
organizations</h3>
<p>Organizations of bureaucrats have fewer options than individual
bureaucrats. The choices an individual bureaucrat faces are described in
§<a href="#sec:dilemma_trilemma" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:dilemma_trilemma">[sec:dilemma_trilemma]</a>.</p>
<p>At the organizational level,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>flatness of organizational hierarchy</p></li>
<li><p>number of supervisors per employee</p></li>
<li><p>create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team</p></li>
<li><p>hiring process</p></li>
<li><p>promotion process</p></li>
<li><p>training process</p></li>
<li><p>firing process</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a government bureaucracy, pay and financial incentives are
typically set outside the organization.</p>
<p>Team managers decide who gets hired and who gets promoted and who
goes to what training and who gets fired.</p>
<p>At the team level, interactions are either lateral (sideways) or
parent-child (top-down) or child-parent (bottom-up). <span
class="citation" data-cites="2014_Jorgensen">(Jorgensen, Bruehl, and
Franke 2014)</span></p>
<p>The child-parent bottom-up upward communication is either inadequate
(too few updates, or not enough information, or insufficient context),
relevant, or excessive. Finding the balance depends on the presenter
knowing the individual audience members so that a tailored message is
provided, and adapting to the specifics of the situation. A weekly or
monthly report to multiple superiors is inadequate.</p>
<p>The parent-child downward communication either is inadequate (no
direction), provides actionable vision, or micromanagement.</p>
<p>For lateral interactions among teams, the tension between cooperation
and competition manifest in struggles over</p>

<h3 id="meetings-for-coordination">Meetings for coordination</h3>
<p>In an organization comprised of more than one person, meetings are a
necessary artifact for facilitating coordination. The coordination can
be explicit, or it can be indirect through signaling.</p>
<p>Meetings are a vital aspect of coordination in a bureaucracy, so tips
are in § <a href="#well-run_meeting" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="well-run_meeting">[well-run_meeting]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="written-communication">Written Communication</h3>
<p>Reports, memos, emails are artifacts of bureaucracy in an
organization. A written record creates evidence about policies and
decisions. Existence of a record can be used for good or for harm.</p>
<h3 id="decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Decision making in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Sometimes events unfold organically without necessarily decisions
being made. Whether because the decision makers are not informed, or
there is an intentional neglect.</p>
<p>One way to avoid the appearance of subjective decision making on
policy is to frame the process as "data driven."</p>
<p>A decision is political when the basis is historical relationships,
maintenance or creation of a relationship, or to enable future
relationships. In contrast, a quantitative decision basis is based on
measurements.</p>
<p>What appears from the outside as “organizational inertia” is internal
delay of decision making and the delay of dissemination. Delay comes
from</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It takes time for each decision maker to gather information,
arrive at a decision, modify processes, disseminate their selection,
justify their selection.</p></li>
<li><p>forcing a continuous variable into a discrete set of choices.
Typically the number of choices is small. Discrete choices for a
continuous variable is a loss of effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p>processes designed to account for cheaters and people with
malicious intent, whether that means a malicious bureaucrat or malicious
subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis paralysis, due to <span>insufficient information, too
much information, which framing is unclear</span></p></li>
<li><p>When other people who are needed to carry out the action push
back, either in disagreement or seeking clarification. The fact that the
organization is not profit driven is important because the justification
for the action isn’t quantitatively obvious. Therefore there’s a higher
burden for communication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="simple decision"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">simple decision</span> has one
correct or beneficial choice and one or more wrong or harmful choices.
The work of decision making is to gather information that identifies
which is the correct or beneficial choice and select that option.</p>
<p>Best case scenario is one person making a well-informed simple
decision that has immediate consequence and the consequence is to the
decision maker. Example from elementary formal education: arithmetic
math problems, multiple choice quizzes, spelling tests, memorization
tests.</p>
<p>A complex decision may have many choices, and there are might not be
a best option. Then a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto frontier</a>
might exist where trade-offs can be made.</p>
<p>As an example of a complex decision made by one person with immediate
consequence and direct relevance to the decision maker, suppose you want
to purchase a car. You car about only two aspects: fuel efficiency and
cost.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="images/pareto_frontier_car_options.pdf"
id="fig:pareto_frontier_cars" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Four cars, L, M, N, and P. Goal is to
spend less money and get better fuel efficiency. Choices not on the
frontier should be avoided, but that doesn’t yield a single
result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A common pareto frontier in generic decision making is the trade-off
between speed, accuracy, and cost.</p>
<p>Pareto frontier analysis works well when there are many options
relative to the number of variables being optimized for. Does not
account for relative importance of different variables.</p>
<p>The assessment does not work as well when there are few choices
relative to the number of variables. For example, suppose there are 10
choices of car and I want high fuel efficiency, high cargo capacity,
maximum number of passengers, stylish, low cost, low maintenance, good
durability, and high resale value. might need to assign weights to each
of these factors.</p>
<p>A typical decision is ill-informed, has diffuse consequences, delayed
impact, and does not affect the decision maker.</p>
<p>Even afterwards a decision can be difficult to evaluate for
correctness because there are multiple stakeholders.</p>
<p>In bureaucratic processes there is rarely a formal assessment of
options. Decisions are rarely recorded.</p>
<p>Decision making by bureaucrats can be informal or formal,
consensus-based or solo.</p>
<p>Most decisions made by bureaucrats do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are trade-offs in timing. Sooner is better, but delaying
allows for more information gathering for a better informed
decision.</p>
<p>Decision makers face options and have the goal of identifying a
beneficial outcome (for which stakeholders?). The goal is to reduce
uncertainty among options. Two ways to reduce uncertainty: gather more
information (takes time), or push the decision down the chain (to people
with narrower view).</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat is going to rely on expert consultation, the decision
maker needs to be confident the expert is not of straying outside their
area of expertise. For example, I don’t rely on a botanist with many
published papers to tell me how to change the oil in my car.</p>
<p>When getting input for a decision, is the expert providing a factual
summary, a predictive assessment, or a value judgement?</p>
<p>There are many ways to gather evidence. Role of measurement and
modeling. Form an opinion, look for evidence to back the outcome.
Instead of measurement, most people rely on history (if they are aware
of it), or what is best for their career, or how to accumulate more
power, or what someone else says to do.</p>
<h3 id="feedback-loops">Feedback loops</h3>
<p>When there is a lack of feedback from customers/users, then someone
has to decide.</p>
<p>when there are multiple competing objectives among different
stakeholders in a zero sum use of resources, how to determine what’s
best? Typically there are feedback loops to guide progress. When
feedback loops are weak or not present, then the most powerful
stakeholder (which is distinct from the biggest or loudest) will
dominate.</p>
<h4 id="special-interest-groups">Special interest groups</h4>
<p>when there is a benefit to a small group and the cost is to a larger
group</p>
<h4 id="spending-taxpayer-dollars">Spending taxpayer dollars</h4>
<p>Suppose I earn $100,000 and the tax rate is 30%. Then my tax money
sent to the government is $30,000.</p>
<p>"In 2021, the [US] government collected $4.05 trillion in revenue."
<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>My taxes of $30,000 is 30000/4050000000000 = 0.00000074%</p>
<p>When I do not maximize the effectiveness of $1,000,000 of government
money, of that misallocated money $0.0074, or about one penny, was taxes
I paid. The feedback loop is weak.</p>
<p>Federal pay is limited to about $220,000<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, so
that raises the feedback to 2 pennies.</p>
<p>The lack of feedback allows waste to go unfelt. There’s no immediate
consequence. Waste is indistinguishable from not enough funding or
insufficient skills</p>
<p>Feedback loop:</p>

<h4 id="tsa-agent-making-a-fair-decision">TSA agent making a fair
decision</h4>
<p>I was going through passport control. There was a TSA officer
directing people into one of two lines. Both lines were long. The lines
were not of equal length. Both lines terminate at a bunch of passport
checking agents. Each passport check takes a minute. Passport checking
TSA officers operate independently and concurrently.</p>
<p>The TSA officer’s perspective is that there are two long lines. His
procedure is two balance the two lines (for fairness). He does this by
pointing people into one of the two lines, with his choice driven which
line has room available.</p>
<p>Two people enter and are directed by the TSA officer. The first
person is directed left, the second goes right. The TSA officer’s job is
completed.</p>
<p>The person in the left line finishes 5 minutes before the person in
the line on the right. This difference in completion time is frustrating
is frustrating for the person who is in the line on the right.</p>
<p>Because the lines are not of equal length, balancing the start of the
line is an suboptimal method. The consequence is that what seems fair to
the TSA officer ends up not being fair for people going through the
line. The TSA officer had incomplete information – the lines are not of
equal length. Because the TSA officer isn’t exposed to the consequence
of is approach, he doesn’t get feedback on whether it is suboptimal or
not.</p>
<p>Lesson: if the people making decisions do not experience the
consequences of those decisions, then they are not incentivized to
improve decision making.</p>
<p>The person in the longer line feels frustrated. The negative feeling
is due to a sense of powerlessness, and that the situation is recurring,
and a better solution is available.</p>
<p>The optimal solution in this situation is to have a single line
feeding the multiple TSA passport checkers. This eliminates the need for
the decision maker.</p>
<h4 id="parking-garage">Parking garage</h4>
<p>Bob parks his car in a parking garage every day. The parking garage
owner charges $20 per day for people to park their car.</p>
<p>Bob recently found that one of the exit gates for the parking garage
is broken. If Bob uses that gate to leave the parking garage, the gate
does not function and Bob cannot exit. Then Bob has to call the parking
gate operator to request an exception (which is granted) and Bob can
then exit that gate, avoiding the $20/day charge.</p>
<p>This action (go to broken gate, request exception, avoid charge) has
been repeated for a long time (months). Bob’s motive is to avoid the $20
parking charge; the cost is a mere phone call and a minor delay. This
cheating behavior harms the parking garage owner’s income. However, the
parking gate operator, serving as intermediary, insulates the parking
garage owner from the interaction with the cheater. The cheating
behavior is small enough that the parking garage owner may not
notice.</p>
<h4 id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time compared to
theft</h4>
<p>Source: <span class="citation" data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove
1995)</span>.</p>
<p>In large organizations, there can be significant bureaucracy
associated with even small purchases. A multi-step review process may be
incurred for a $2000 acquisition.</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>Those metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people’s time.
Consider a meeting of 10 people and each person’s cost is $200 per hour.
A wasted meeting is not unusual and certainly would not incur
bureaucratic review processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally
the same – $2000. Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes
a loss of productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth
of time is not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In fact, organizations default to meetings (even recurring meetings)
rather than not meet. And being late to a meeting is accepted.</p>
<p>We can debate the differences between theft of materials and theft of
time. The financial argument is clear.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bureaucracy">History of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>After making two points in this area, I’m going to skip the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy#History">history of
bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<p>First, bureaucracy has repeatedly arisen independently in a variety
of cultures lasting for timescales that exceed the lifespan of one
person. That indicates the current situation is not a fluke or
coincidence. There is some utility (or pathology) that is consistently
recurring.</p>
<p>Second, bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans!
Subjective policy enforcement in support of an organization arises in
pre-human tribes, visible in groups of modern apes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_nsZlcC12g">history</a></p>
<h2 id="scope-of-bureaucracy">Scope of bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a bureaucrat?</h3>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The “policy” might simply
be “take money from customer in exchange for items and gas,” but the
subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of room for the
cashier to shape the customer’s experience. Does the cashier greet the
customer when the customer enters the store? Does the cashier look at
the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How quickly does the
cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances that are left to the cashier
in the execution of the store policy means there is room for subjective
application of the policy.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks, bankers, and plumbers. Public school
teachers, state and federal police, military members, tax collectors,
and other state workers are government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies. Enforcement of
quality standards is the most obvious area. Pacing of work is a
negotiation.</p>
<p>Structured environments like sports featuring well defined rules do
not eliminate bureaucracy. Teammates use subjective policies on who to
work with and how to best leverage their strengths and exploit the
opponent’s weaknesses. Referees make subjective determinations about
rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In this scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters, both to the employee
and to the business. The risk of not self-identifying as a bureaucrat is
that you won’t grasp how much control you have in implementing and
enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly follow
rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and you
will harm the business/institution you are applying the rules for.
Adapting policies to circumstances is the value of having judgement
capacity.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer/citizen perspective, if you
don’t think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won’t perceive
the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as fixed and inflexible,
you will harm your ability to make progress. If a rule was made by a
human, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces the
rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a
modification or an exception?</p>
<p>If you don’t think about a bureaucratic framing, you might think the
store clerk enforcing a policy is because they don’t like you, and you
might not recognize that talking with a manager could be more
productive.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you’ll behave
differently in your job. The paradigm of “just tell me what to do” is
the default (learned in school) and you won’t know how to engage with
coworkers/bosses since they are not friends. You will be less likely to
understand how to leverage the organization; identify collective wisdom.
Thinking from the perspective of a bureaucrat explains why evangelizing
within org is relevant. You’ll see your coworkers as competitors for
promotion.</p>
<p>if you think of yourself as merely a cog in a machine, you are less
likely notice that you exert influence in the process and you are less
likely to recognize the autonomy available to you. if you think "I have
a real job [e.g., nurse, cashier, teacher], so therefore I’m not a
bureaucrat", you are less likely to recognize the subjective power you
have in interactions with the public if you think, "I’m at the bottom of
my organization’s hierarchy, therefore I do not have power", you are
less likely to notice the autonomy when it is available.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as part of a bureaucratic process,
you’ll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won’t
perceive opportunities to negotiate because the processes seem fixed
instead of subjective. You won’t recognize motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-people-in-a-bureaucracy">Number of people in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book primarily
focuses on the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization.
This might be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>) up to millions of people.</p>
<p>There are tens of companies that employ more than a million people<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>, including Walmart, Amazon, and
McDonald’s. Bureaucracy emerges at a far smaller scale, is scale
invariant, and is generic across sectors.</p>
<p>Small companies with a few people incur bureaucracy. Non-profit
organizations encounter bureaucracy. The complexity of the tasks may be
different, but the same scale-independent patterns can emerge because of
a common factor: human behavior.</p>
<p>Size of bureaucracy scales with the complexity of the problem. Size
of bureaucracy depends on - How old is the bureaucracy - How big is
community - How diverse is community</p>
<p>Scaling a bureaucracy up is easier than scaling down.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-bureaucracy-exist">Why does bureaucracy exist? <span
id="sec:alternatives_to_bureaucracy"

<p>Can’t we just do the work?</p>
<p>In this section we’ll explore a few alternatives to bureaucracy.</p>
<h4 id="efficient-bureaucracy">Efficient Bureaucracy</h4>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no bureaucracy, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information. Then the management
process of building consensus becomes unnecessary. There is no need to
fight over resources (money, staffing) and no need to fight over
direction.</p>
<p>While that ideal scenario is not going to happen, it points to how to
improve bureaucratic efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each person has the same information.</p></li>
<li><p>each person applies the same decision making process
consistently</p></li>
<li><p>every person has the same incentives</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is inefficient is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>not everyone has the same information</p></li>
<li><p>processes are inconsistent</p></li>
<li><p>incentives vary</p></li>
<li><p>Imprecise language</p></li>
<li><p>Using opinions and experience rather than collect data and
analyze data</p></li>
<li><p>prioritizing by putting out fires rather than attacking largest
issues</p></li>
<li><p>not responding to communications (email, phone,
meetings)</p></li>
<li><p>being late to meetings</p></li>
<li><p>scope creep</p></li>
<li><p>planned scope and capability scope (due to staffing or skills) is
mismatched</p></li>
<li><p>silos of operation</p></li>
<li><p>lies</p></li>
<li><p>mistakes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add the issue that each person’s reference experiences are
unique. As a consequence, decision making is subjective.</p>
<h4 id="perfect-bureaucracy">Perfect bureaucracy</h4>
<p>Starting with “perfect bureaucracy”, there are two perspectives: that
of the subject and that of the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the subject of a bureaucratic organization,
perfect bureaucracy means minimizing the time the subject waits on a
decision, and means getting perfectly correct decisions, decisions are
consistent across subjects and circumstances, decisions take into
account all relevant factors, and there is zero cost to the subject. Any
process deviating from those expectations is a noticble detriment to the
subject, leading to the negative reference experiences of bureaucracy.
Nevermind that the desires are unreasonable and conflicting. In a real
bureaucracy, subjects have a negative or neutral experience, with rare
positive interactions.</p>
<p>Perfect bureaucracy for a bureaucrat means all information is
available, information is immediately available, and there is no moral
ambiguity (answer is objective). Trade-offs become trivial and the
emotional toll of the work goes to zero. Then the bureaucrat is able to
serve subjects (an emotionally rewarding prospect). Note that this job
might be feel hollow if all decisions are obvious. In a real
bureaucracy, the typical experience is negative or neutral, punctuated
by glimpses of satisfaction.</p>
<h4
id="everyone-do-their-own-thing-no-coordination-no-bureaucracy">Everyone
do their own thing – No coordination, No bureaucracy</h4>
<p>The minimal scenario to start from is to imagine a single person
working on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is
relatively easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does
not recur. In that situation, building consensus is irrelevant and no
process is required. Even then, it is often the case that this simple
task involves the use of shared limited resources – basic essentials
like water, air, land. If you task involves use of those things, then
how is equitable use determined among consumers?</p>
<p>Even for simplistic tasks, the concept of self-serve shared resources
for each person is not trivial. independent allocation of shared
resources breaks down and access is determined by violence.</p>
<p>Most of what you do occurs beyond the limits of simplicity and thus
incurs some concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks. Sometimes the order of the
subtasks matters, so we need to track the dependencies. A recurring
multi-step process with documentation is starting to have features of
bureaucracy, but lacks the need for consensus.</p>
<p>If one person lacks the skills relevant to a multi-step process, they
may engage another person to help. The interaction may be informal

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">libertarian</a>). If
the parties working on the task fail to reach consensus, what is the
recourse? Options include physical violence, threats, or involving a
third party (e.g., a court with lawyers and judges).</p>
<p>To summarize, two aspects necessitate bureaucracy: shared resources
and shared responsibility. If you want to manage resources and
responsibilities, how is that policy decided? Building consensus is
relevant, but what is the process for establishing consensus?</p>
<p>Nepotism and cultural norms and religious practices served this role
prior to bureaucracy.</p>
<h4 id="limit-bureaucracy-to-a-single-decider">limit bureaucracy to a

<p>If we are going to live in a society, what if we had a single person
deciding?</p>
<p>how fast could that be?</p>
<p>Good decisions can’t be instantaneous – the OODA cycle is
necessary.</p>
<p>If OODA takes X minutes, then in a 10 hour work day that’s a max of
600/X decisions.</p>
<p>Monarchies and dictatorships the rely on a single decider. A simpler
model to understand, but difficult to handle all the edge cases for
large society. A single decider doesn’t scale for the number of
decisions needed, so the decider then appoints bureaucrats to
subjectively implement policies.</p>
<p>perfect bureaucracy of one person doesn’t scale. Can’t say "just
automate everything" because carrying out the approach requires a staff
to implement. Automation isn’t free – it requires creation and
maintenance</p>

<p>If you think bureaucracy sucks and it should be removed or replaced,
then the parable of Chesterton’s fence applies. Understanding not the
history of the bureaucracy, but the reason it exists</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists ... a fence or gate erected across a road. The more
modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the
use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type
of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I
certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you
can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you
to destroy it.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"

</blockquote>
<p>Suppose that you don’t have oversight of your processes in your
finances and your resources. A small percentage of the population say
0.1%, will take advantage of that lack of a per side for their own game.
Those malicious actors show as subjects of bureaucracy and as
bureaucrats within the organization. <span class="citation"
data-cites="2012_Schneier">(Schneier 2012)</span> calls these
defectors</p>
<p>The short answer is that bureaucracy is a response to the complexity
of a problem being solved. To see why that is, let’s start simple and
then increase the complexity.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat’s identity is subsumed into service for the
organization they are part of. At the same time, bureaucracy enables the
bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being part of a larger
organization. A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an
organization than by working alone. Sometimes the cost of being part of
the organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.</p>
<p>What if we completely avoided bureaucracy? That question is better
worded by replacing “bureaucracy" with “coordination of stakeholders".
If you avoid coordination of stakeholders, you either are constrained to
only work on tasks that involve one person, or you get is random
(uncoordinated) interactions.</p>
<p>What if we minimized bureaucracy? Again, try replacing “bureaucracy"
in that question with “coordination of stakeholders". The goal of
“minimizing coordination" probably isn’t the real objective. To be more
precise, a specific objective might be “minimize time spent executing
the task" (which takes a lot of coordination prior to the task
execution) or “minimize the level of distraction to stakeholders" (chunk
the coordination time). Another strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is
to reduce the number of stakeholders involved. For a given task
complexity, this means having smarter people who have more skills.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-bureaucracy-so-hard">Why is bureaucracy so hard?</h3>
<p>When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy,
positive attribution is made to the people involved. Or ease of a
solution makes the bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems
obvious. When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy,
complaints are about the incompetence of the people involved, or the
incomprehensibleness of the system. Don’t these bureaucrats know how to
do their job? Why isn’t the solution obvious? Why does this system not
work for me?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst working-class Americans, government is now generally seen as
being made up of two sorts of people: ’politicians,’ who are blustering
crooks and liars but can at least occasionally be voted out of office,
and ’bureaucrats,’ who are condescending elitists almost impossible to
uproot.</p>

How much work is attributable to cover your ass? How much work due to
ill-informed decisions? How much relevant work is carried out by
insufficiently trained workers.</p>
<p>There are many nuances not visible to external perspective:</p>

<p>Why bureaucracy is complicated : effective action benefits from
relevant information. Information is from function which requires
process which decompose to steps. Map people who take action to
steps.</p>
<h1 id="bureaucracy-in-general">Bureaucracy in general</h1>
<h2 id="each-phase-of-life-involves-bureaucracy">Each Phase of Life
involves Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>In life there are some standard milestones: birth, education, work,
death. Each of these milestones involves engaging bureaucracy.</p>
<p>In the conventional progression of life, relationships are specific
to phases. Each phase is a different experience of bureaucracy, and
different roles act as bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Birth is marked by getting a name, registering with the state,
initiating medical records. These tasks are administered by bureaucrats
who manage the processes that implement policies.</p>
<p>pre-education childhood: primarily family, possible community
members, caretakers</p>
<p>The education process involves the community, typically as a public
school, private school, or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the
frontline bureaucrat is the teacher.</p>
<p>The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate,
graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a
large organization.</p>
<p>Single choice decision examples: math problems, multiple choice tests
School doesn’t prepare students for paradoxes</p>
<p>Where you sit in the classroom matters. Being in the front means you
will be exposed to fewer distractions, more likely to pay attention.</p>
<p>How were you taught? Did you have any input on the method? Who
taught? Did you like them? Were they friendly, knowledgeable, and
approachable? How did you learn? What worked best? What didn’t work, and
why not? What did you learn? What do you wish you had learned?</p>
<p>What resources are available now for you to learn from? Do you like
learning? you have the freedom to pursue what ever intellectual
endeavors you want</p>
<p>you get to choose the book you want. You don’t even need to pick just
one – you can pick lots of books and figure out which author style best
fits you. You can also choose the level of difficulty – very basic and
beginner level, or more advanced (depending on where you are, rather
than where a class in school is supposed to be).</p>
<p>25 years of school did not prepare me for addressing challenges at
work. I learned how to approach technical issues and develop solutions.
Problem and solution paradigm removed the negotiation and situation
discovery steps. While in school I limited socializing. I’ve found that
social skills and political savvy are at least as important for getting
significant change implemented. I’ve accepted this reality. If I had
been aware of this gap earlier in my career, the projects I worked on
that failed adoption by users may have been more successful</p>
<p>primary education: family, friends, teachers</p>
<p>education process roles and expectations vary over time</p>
<p>college, graduate school: friends, teachers, advisors</p>
<p>Less than 0.5% of the United States population serves in the
military. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>The military, with rigid hierarchy and defined protocols, is also a
distinct experience.</p>
<p>Within the employment phase, there are pairs start and end events
which may apply: hiring or getting hired; firing, getting fired, or
quitting.</p>
<p>employment: managers above you, peer employees, people you manage are
all members of an organization.</p>
<p>healthcare. Doctors and nurses are bureaucrats; the hospital or
clinic is the organization.</p>
<p>Death can invoke both the medical system and the government.</p>
<p>All of these roles and relationship involve subjectively administered
policies within an organization. However, merely recognizing the role of
bureaucrats is not a complete description of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Toilet paper at the hospital If you go to a hospital, use the
bathroom, and find there is no toilet paper, that would indicate a
deficiency. Someone didn’t refill the toilet paper. Since the person who
normally refills toilet paper wasn’t also a user, they aren’t directly
impacted by the lack of toilet paper. So someone needs to have a routine
of checking bathrooms for toilet paper availability. Money spent
checking to toilet paper is money not spent on the primary mission of
the hospital. Minimizing checking is important, so a feedback mechanism
is instituted – a phone number to text regarding bathroom status at the
hospital.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-bureaucracy-is-nearly-impossible">Avoiding Bureaucracy
is Nearly Impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
completely on your own, with no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging with society. Even then, personal routines
are a self-imposed bureaucracy.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, as members of a society bureaucracy is necessary
for our rights. We prove our name by cooperating with other people, and
our name helps us claim our citizenship. That’s a subjective policy that
<span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">stakeholders</span> in society agree
to.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy are attractive alternatives
bureaucracy. The way participants in modern society strive for
self-sufficiency is by denying their dependence on modern society.
That’s a relabeling of selfishness which feels better.</p>
<p>The specific way a society is constructed (democratic, authoritarian,
dictatorship, anarchy) is irrelevant – bureaucracy is still present.
Even the libertarian view of relying on contract enforcement implies
some about of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Not all bureaucracy is due to the state, nor is bureaucracy confined
to companies. Parenting involves coming up with situation-specific
requirements for children, with the organization being the family. Dress
codes for team are arbitrary standards inconsistently enforced. Store
clerks are bureaucrats, as are website forum moderators. Content
moderation is the process of inconsistently enforcing arbitrary
standards. This mindset even permeates individuals as internalized
expectations of policy and enforcement when no one else is present.</p>
<p>Recognizing instances of bureaucracy enables more skillful
interaction, whether as a bureaucrat or as a subject. The remainder of
this section illustrates both the view of a person interacting with
bureaucracy as a <span data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>, and the perspective
of bureaucrats working within organizations.</p>
<h2 id="bureaucracy-as-accidental-legacy-or-essential">Bureaucracy as
Accidental, Legacy, or Essential</h2>
<p><span data-acronym-label="essential bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">essential bureaucracy</span> is the
minimum processes and staffing and skills necessary to address the
complexity of the problem space. This is tricky since the optimization
can be with respect to resilience to change, resilience to edge cases,
staff turn-over, speed experienced by consumer, financial cost,
organization time, organization staffing level.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is either accidental or legacy. Accidental
bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what is needed, or when
skills of the people involved are insufficient for the complexity a
problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the situation changes but the
processes do not. Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem
easy: have better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to
the problem, and change processes as problems evolve.</p>
<p>Having sufficient knowledge is often infeasible, especially for
complex problems at large scale. Having the people with the right skills
assumes a pipeline of relevant talents and that people in that pipeline
won’t be poached for other problem. Keeping up with evolving problems
depends on having resources to change, and having a defined process for
changing process.</p>

<em>Why this feels true</em>: <em>What this is missing</em>:</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
inefficient</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Expressed by both subjects and bureaucrats
who observe seemingly wasteful processes. <em>What this is missing</em>:
If bureaucracy were truly inefficient (not allocating resources in the
most efficient way), then it would be replaced by a more efficient
approach. The key is to ask, “efficient with respect to what metric?”
The metric of money, time, number of people, stability, robustness to
perturbation. Second, what would motivate improved efficiency? Without
incentives, change is less likely.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is due to
malfeasance.</strong><br />
The specific number of malicious bureaucrats ranges from “all of the
participants” to “just enough to be problematic.”<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: There are bad actors. <em>What this is
missing</em>: Bureaucracy is unavoidable, and most of the participants
are earnestly trying to help or are not making a positive contribution.
Processes within bureaucracy are used to deal with malicious
bureaucrats, like isolation or promotion.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is a sign of decay

<em>Why this feels true</em>:<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Bureaucracy is unavoidable emergence in
any/every organization.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>Duration of a task is how long it
would take one person to accomplish</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>:<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Fails to account for the overhead of
interaction and delays due to asynchronous engagement.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>Consider the average or majority

Why this simplification is misleading: For sufficiently large ensembles,
the outliers alter the outcome. The larger the ensemble, the more
significant the role of the outlier minority.</p>

<p>When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that
presents a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma">dilemma</a>.
The name for the case with three viable options is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>.</p>
<p>that is a reduction of a complicated situation to one variable.</p>
<p>folk wisdom on decision making in the face of dilemmas</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law">Hick’s law</a>:
“increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Law of
Triviality</a>: “people within an organization commonly or typically
give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.”</p>
<p>Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and
trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways
to simplify situations into a dilemma are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>start with a single variable, e.g., "how much data gathering",
and force it into a binary choice "more data gathering" versus "less
data gathering"</p></li>
<li><p>start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and
reduce it to a false dichotomy of zero-sum options: "more data
gathering" vs "more planning." The actual trade-space involves
optimization of multiple objectives, like (maximize productivity) and
(minimize risk) and (maximize quality) and (maximize employee
satisfaction) and (minimize latency).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These over-simplifications neglect both the continuous nature of the
trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a specific
situation.</p>
<p>The choices are described here in simplified representation as a
starting point intended to introduce the decision space relevant to
individual bureaucrats. Awareness of these dilemmas and trilemmas are
intended to spark creative imagination about the nuances specific to
your situation.</p>
<p>Do not accept the dilemmas presented here as the final framing.
Thinking in terms of a limited spectrum of opportunities neglects
nuances that enable more creative approaches. Ponder theses dilemmas
prior to the pressure of real-time decision making. Recognize dilemmas
and trilemmas and then avoid them by adapting to the local conditions
and specific people available to help.</p>
<p>Decision making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional
stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for
the decision maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and any
compromise will be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh on deciders.</p>
<p>Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here are
occur concurrently and continuously. The dilemmas are inter-dependent
due to both to the common variables and the constrained resources.
Selecting an option for one dilemma alters the options available in
other dilemmas.</p>
<p>Oscillation between approaches can be caused by change of management,
accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one solution, the
desire for promotion ( change as progress), desire for cost savings. The
rate of oscillation is an indicator of the half-life of institutional
memory.</p>

<p>The logistics of gathering data can be measured, but there are other
subjective aspects to account for as well. Making a decision has an
emotional toll on the decider due to the risk of failure. Also,
decisions are made in a social context, with decision makers accounting

<p>Gathering data (Dilemma <a href="#table:gather_data_lots-vs-little"

from planning (Dilemma <a href="#table:planning"

is possible to do a lot of planning with only a little information
gathered, and it is feasible to have lots of data and do no
planning.</p>

<p>Making a decision imposes a bound on how much time is available for
both gathering data and planning. Time is zero sum, so more time
gathering data is less time planning. Similarly, the number of people
available for data gathering and planning is bounded, and tasking people
is a zero sum choice.</p>

<p>Centralization is often carried out for the purposes of cost
efficiency. The cost savings are due to de-duplication and having less
slack. Both of those “savings” are a decrease of redundancy, which has a
cost when there are unexpected fluctuations in need.</p>
<p>Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with the
corresponding decrease in choices.</p>
<p>Centralization (de-localization) can decrease the value assigned to
feedback from people using the service because personal relations are
de-valued.</p>
<p>The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on
relationships motivates the creation of local services.</p>

<p>Trilemma: <strong>Do you work for your team, your manager, or
yourself?</strong> Being a member of a team that operates within a
hierarchy is tough. One reason is the question of who you are working
for. The trilemma is whether you work for yourself, work for your
supervisor, or work for your team. Ideally you can find ways to do all
three, but that is not always the case.</p>
<p>Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a
potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each
team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the
action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy –
they are accountable to the boss.</p>
<p>In the approach "team members are directed by their supervisor," the
synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck
(for decision making and for creativity and for planning).</p>
<p>The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their
supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in
an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers.</p>
<p> <br />
A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are
<strong>fast, inexpensive, good; choose two</strong>. (This is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Project
management triangle</a>.)<br />
In other words, the options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of
resources)</p></li>
<li><p>good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., a clever
solution)</p></li>
<li><p>fast and inexpensive will be low quality</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
Three "so what" for dilemmas/trilemmas 1) construct pareto frontier to
identify non-optimal choices that can be eliminated 2) instead of assess
variables in isolation, assess in workflows 3) raise subjective
decisions to explicit discussion with stakeholders so that disagreement
can be negotiated</p>
<h2 id="unavoidable-hazards-of-bureaucracy">Unavoidable Hazards of
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:unavoidable_hazards"
label="sec:unavoidable_hazards"></span></h2>
<p>In a bureaucracy there are certain challenges that cannot be avoided.
The value of recognizing them is to understand that what you’re
experiencing isn’t an anomaly. The problem isn’t unique to you, your
circumstances, your coworkers, or the organization. The cause is the
combination of all those factors.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Separation of responsibility and accountability</strong>.<br />
Each bureaucrat in an organization has responsibilities associated with
their role. The ability to complete the tasks associated the role are
not wholly within the scope of the bureaucrat’s control. Even if there
is a desire for action, the action might not be immediately feasible
because of a dependence on another person or process.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Appreciation for being an effective bureaucrat is
rare.</strong><br />
If you do your job well, at best no one will notice.</p>
<p>“No one [thanks teachers] for policing cheating. Not the cheaters,
not the honest students who feel inconvenienced and mistrusted, and
certainly not the school [administrators] who have to process academic
dishonesty paperwork.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>The number of thank you cards sent to <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> meat
inspectors, <a href="https://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and
Health Administration</a> regulators, <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a>, <a
href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> is
likely small.</p>
<p>There are counter examples in public service bureaucracy. Law
enforcement is thanked when there is a victim of a crime. The military
is held in high regard.</p>
<p> <br />
 <br />
<strong>decision-makers being under-informed, unknowledgeable, and
inexperienced.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>inability to gather data due to time constraints.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Defining success is subjective and dynamic</strong>.<br />
Who defines success and for which audience in a bureaucratic
organization is subjective because of the lack of feedback mechanisms.
Consequences may not be immediately obvious. Worse, how success is
defined can be changed at any time – there’s no need for
consistency.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Change threatens incumbents</strong>.<br />
Change of plans, roles, tasks, resources, flatness of org, scope,
technology</p>
<p> <br />
<strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">Diffusion
of responsibility</a> in the bureaucracy</strong><br />
A specific task needs to be completed, and action requires involvement
of multiple collaborators.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Diffusion of blame in the bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
 <br />
<strong>High latency feedback</strong>.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Weak feedback</strong>.<br />
 <br />
<strong>The person making the rules that you follow doesn’t actually
know what they’re doing</strong>.<br />
Choices then include * follow the rules that are not correct. Decreases
productivity and morale or * you can violate the rules and be more
effective or * you can work the change the rules (and then are not doing
the work that’s needed)</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Rarely get to pick who is on the team</strong>.<br />
When a task requires collaboration, there is rarely a choice of who you
get to work with.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Rarely able to alter team membership</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>inadequate resources: staffing, time, money</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>outcomes for the team are ill-defined and constantly
shifting</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>the organization has a lack of vision; or has vision but no
plan; or has vision and plan but no consensus.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>progress depends on subjective decision making</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>easier to ask for big money than small money</strong><br />
Processes are scale invarient – doesn’t matter whether you’re asking for
$1000 or $100,000, the process is the same.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>flux of people and processes</strong><br />
staff turn-over, changing conditions, changing timelines, change of
vision, and the need to be promoted. in a bureaucracy, consistency
doesn’t yield promotion.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Why are there so many rules?</strong> - to address edge cases
and malicious or dumb people</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>so much paperwork/forms</strong> Why is Red tape endemic to
bureaucracy? paperwork as a form of coordination in processes to
facilitate decentralized decision making.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Everything is slower</strong><br />
what is meant is "slower than desired" or "slower than I imagined in my
simplified model"</p>
<p>One reason progress is slower than expected is because there aren’t
as many hours available as imagined.</p>
<p>In a bureaucracy the actual time spent working is less than the
number of hours you get paid for. Breaks during work, vacation from
work, holidays, sick leave.</p>

<strong>The larger a hierarchy, the ratio of workers to managers gets
worse</strong><br />
As complexity and workload increase, the number of staff needed
increase. To facilitate coordination, managers arise. The amount of work
being done in a bureaucracy can be small compared to the number of
participants.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:growth_of_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:growth_of_bureaucracy">2.6</a>a, the ratio of
workers to participants is 3:3=1. When a manager is added, the ratio is
3:4 = 0.75. Adding a second team with dedicated management puts the
ratio at 6:9=0.66. Finally, with a dedicated administrative team (ie HR,
accounting), the ratio is 6:13=0.46.</p>

<p> <br />
<strong>Each person in a bureaucracy has multiple roles</strong> To
limit the expansion of the bureaucracy. The multiple roles come from
multiple relationships necessary to span an organization larger than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Bureaucracy is inefficient and wasteful</strong><br />
Can you explain a pareto frontier for multiple objectives like speed,
cost, accuracy?</p>
<p>Because decisions by bureaucrats are subjective, there is significant
risk of being wrong or being called out by others as being wrong.
Therefore, a motive to cover your ass for decisions made. Unnecessary
work is carried out.</p>
<p>Different participants have different motives, and the aggregation
needed for coordination is inefficient regardless of what metric
efficiency is measured against.</p>
<p>Another example: Inefficiency of changing the requirements on a
project partway through. If an objective quantitative measure were
available, the ROI could be determined.</p>
<p>Efficiency is typically assessed from the perspective of a serial
process – a single worker could accomplish this task faster, so why
involve 10 people and get a slower, more burdensome result? The Mythical
Man Month manifests <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s law</a>.
Dividing a task among 10 people does not make the task 10x quicker. It’s
not valid to expect that a task which takes 1 person 1 hour to perfectly
scale so 10 people should be able to accomplish 10 results in 1
hour.</p>
<p>Inefficiency of process is similar. I need to file a request to
replace the lightbulb in my office. Compared to the serial “I’ll just
replace the lightbulb myself by running to the hardware store and
purchasing one."</p>
<p>The excess resources characterized as waste are similarly driven by
the serial-based assessment of what one person would require to carry
out the task.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Scope creep</strong><br />
The customer wants more, and the exploration of what’s possible is
exciting (a positive experience).</p>
<p>The creator hears more work. This implies a few trade-off options,
all of which are negative for one or both parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sticking with the original terms (telling the customer "no",
which is negative for both parties)</p></li>
<li><p>re-negotiation for additional compensation (a burden to both
parties)</p></li>
<li><p>the programmer doing more for the same pay, which means less
money per effort (yielding a less happy programmer)</p></li>
<li><p>decreasing existing efforts to fit the additional new
requirements (yielding a less happy customer)</p></li>
<li><p>even if the programmer is getting paid by the hour, additional
work means the end product will be delayed to accommodate additional
features (yielding a less happy customer)</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
<strong>Migrating technologies</strong><br />
The person implementing the transition has to be educated in both the
old and new technology. the legacy code has to be migrated to the new
implementation convincing stakeholders; may require synchronization
difficulty scales with the number of stakeholders</p>
<h2 id="how-to-be-an-effective-bureaucrat">How to be an Effective
Bureaucrat<span id="sec:effective_bureaucrat"

<p>So far I’ve described dilemmas in §<a href="#sec:dilemma_trilemma"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:dilemma_trilemma">[sec:dilemma_trilemma]</a> and
unavoidable hazards in §<a href="#sec:unavoidable_hazards"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:unavoidable_hazards">[sec:unavoidable_hazards]</a>.
Given this nuanced view of the complexity of bureaucracy, how can you
leverage that insight?</p>
<p>Baseline assumptions are that you are a good person, you are
technically skilled at your technical duties, and you are a good project
manager.</p>
<p>Superpowers of a bureaucrat in a bureaucratic organization that
facilitate cooperation and progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you strive for and demonstrate transparency. You share
information with stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>you seek information from stakeholders</p></li>
<li><p>apply consistent processes (rather than being reactionary and
applying ad hoc responses)</p></li>
<li><p>hold others (and yourself) accountable</p></li>
<li><p>account for varying incentives and reference experiences</p></li>
<li><p>communicate more effectively</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-tasking, or, more accurately, task switching. The switch
among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an
externally-generated pause. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation">pipeline
your activities</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Be prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone shows
up with resources.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to
enable your progress, <u>presence creates priority</u>.</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly replying to incoming requests. This allows other people’s
tasks to either be resolved or have a clear response about when progress
can be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>intellectual empathy – what is it; how to grow it. Theory of mind
for thinking. shadow peers and bosses</p></li>
<li><p>process empathy. Observe deviations and exceptions that cause
processes to come into existence.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid unintentionally dropping tasks or requests. This requires
capturing incoming requests and then providing a response about
prioritization and status. This matters because other participants in
the organization should regard you as reliable in a positive
sense.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How to know that you are making progress on a specific task</p>
<ul>
<li><p>in less time</p></li>
<li><p>with less effort</p></li>
<li><p>that I previously wanted to but wasn’t able to</p></li>
<li><p>with fewer resources</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Bureaucracy induces emotional response in participants because things
don’t work they way each person wants. This can lead emotionally to
frustration and then apathy. Understanding how things operate in a
bureaucracy decreases the anger.</p>
<p>Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of
powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some third person decides your fate: this is the whole essence of
bureaucracy.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to
subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The sense of powerlessness is somewhat valid, in that you are as a
bureaucrat giving up some power compared to your ability to act
individually. That is the trade for working with others</p>
<p> <br />
A process feels bureaucratic when the subject is exposed to more than
one step to get something done that if one person were doing it would be
simpler. Consolidation from the subject’s perspective decreases the
apparent bureaucracy. The barrier to implementation is the necessary
coordination among different stakeholders who receive no benefit from
the coordination. Externalizing the coordination to the subject is what
causes the sense of bureaucracy.</p>
<p> <br />
Don’t rely on one person or one idea for your success. Don’t spread
yourself too thin.</p>
<p> <br />
what to do when you get stuck? look up stream, look downstream, look to
peers</p>
<p> <br />
When you are asked to take on additional work, avoid responding with
“that’s not my job." If the request is misguided and your perception is
that is really is the responsibility of another person, ask if the
requester is aware of that other person’s responsibilities. If you are
to really take on the work, get guidance on re-prioritizing and make
sure the request is documented in writing.</p>
<p> <br />
If there’s something you want to accomplish, strive for influence
without authority instead of working to gain control over resources
(e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following: “In this organization X
is important to me, but I can’t do X right now because I don’t have
enough power in the org. So I’ll get promoted and then do X."</p>
<p> <br />
<em>TODO</em>: <strong>Learn the perspectives of those around
you.</strong><br />
The relevance of knowing the paradoxes including dilemmas and
unavoidable hazards, is that you should talk explicitly to your fellow
bureaucrats about these specific topics in conversation. Not that the
goal is to find consensus or agreement. But to find what the other
person is thinking so that you can account for their processes</p>
<p><em>TODO</em>: <strong>Account for holistic view</strong><br />
The specific circumstances of the challenges you face as a bureaucrat
depend on the individual people involved, what the purpose of the
bureaucracy is, what technology is available for implementation of
bureaucracy, and the resources (staffing, money, time).</p>
<p><em>TODO</em>: <strong>Learn the history of the
problem</strong><br />
This goes beyond Chesterton’s fence, which focuses about why the current
approach is in placed. Learning the history of a problem means what has
been tried before and failed? How did the previous iterations evolve
into the current situation? Was the cause personalities, insufficient
resources, inadequate technology? What’s changed that enables this
approach to be better? What do you know that prior attempts didn’t?</p>
<p><em>TODO</em>: <strong>Concurrently work on 3 remedies</strong><br />
<em>TODO</em>: <strong>Minimize <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">external
costs</a></strong><br />
A solution that externalizes costs harms the greater organization and

in bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specifics of the job, there are specific attributes
that make a candidate more likely to be successful in a bureaucracy. In

principle</a>: “people in a hierarchy tend to rise to "a level of
respective incompetence": employees are promoted based on their success
in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer
competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to
another.”</p>
<p>This might manifest as recurring failure. More likely, your
incompetence will blind you to your own failures.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to the peter principal, do not promote unless

<p>Promotion is a critical aspect of designing incentives for behavior.

for status, for authority.</p>
<p>promotion of individual (rather than team) results in hero
culture</p>
<p>What is preventing innovation is lack of risk taking. Actual risk
means potential for failure. fear of failure because culture avoids
failure due to concerns of waste. Also, anyone who fails can use this
argument, but that isn’t the same as “fail fast” because what’s critical
is learning from failure and sharing that insight gained so other’s

<p>How an organization’s culture is conveyed by artifacts like org
charts is subtle and can be overanalyzed.</p>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the “org chart"). Normally the CEO is
at the top of the chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed
employees are at the bottom. See Fig. <a

<h2 id="you-are-an-individual-in-an-organization">You are an Individual
in an Organization</h2>
<p>This section focuses on the individual bureaucrat operating within an
organization.</p>
<p>There is no neutral member of a bureaucracy. Either you are
contributing to the organization, or you are sapping resources from the
organization. This is because the organization operates in a zero-sum
game for resource allocation.</p>
<h3 id="ideas-for-innovation-within-a-bureaucracy">Ideas for Innovation
within a Bureaucracy<span id="sec:innovation"
label="sec:innovation"></span></h3>
<p>0) people observe problems and challenges in their environment 1)
share ideas for innovation 2) implementing these suggestions require
either - a change of existing processes or - new processes or - an
investment of work (which may not succeed – there’s risk) 3)
implementation would take you away from your current work, and it might
involve skills you don’t have 4) someone else implements it, so they get
the credit for having done the work 5) if the idea saves money or time,
there’s no monetary reward</p>
<p>Your idea could fail because it’s not a good idea. It could also fail
because someone doesn’t like you, or the idea doesn’t account for some
dependency you weren’t aware of, or it might conflict with other changes
in progress.</p>
<p>The solution is you need to build a coalition of people willing to
fight for the idea on your behalf so that when you’re not present, the
idea is still proceeding to implementation. That puts the threshold at
“so important other people are willing to pause whatever they were
working on and take up your cause.”</p>
<p>Which leads to external observers to conclude something like the
following simplification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats
hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better
results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top
of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"

</blockquote>
<p>Subjective decisions mean choices have to be defensible. Leads to
conservative decisions and risk aversion and decrease innovation.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-of-participants">Motivation of participants</h3>
<p>In an organization where you are a paid bureaucrat, you are either
actively working for improvement of the organization, or your existence
is parasitic to the organization. There is no "idle" status for paid
employees.</p>
<p>Motivations of participants are rarely “how can I make the company
more successful" or even “how can I sell/produce more product"? Usually
motivation is based on personal success in various manifestations, which
leads to emergent phenomena which appears confounding to observers
outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Not too efficient such that I lose my job, and not so inefficient
that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing the efficiency
of bureaucracy is good for the organization and the outcomes, but can be
harmful to the bureaucrat’s career.</p>
<p>Career stability is a benefit, and it can be leveraged to take more
risk. However, it typically manifests as inaction by an employee.
There’s no harm to the employee in not taking action. If an employee
doesn’t do anything, nothing bad will happen to that employee. Career
stability decreases extrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>motivations: stability, money, travel, problem solving, like being
associated with org, logistical convenience (“the office is near where I
lived.”)</p>
<h3 id="creating-change-in-the-organization">Creating change in the
organization<span id="sec:creating_change"
label="sec:creating_change"></span></h3>
<p>If the organization you are a participant in has no problems or
challenges, this subsection can be skipped. For bureaucrats in
organizations that do have structural problems, this part of the
guidebook provides points to ponder independent of the specific
problem.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you have unique insight on the problems the
organization faces, and you have unique leverage to alter the situation.
While you could proceed haphazardly, an effective bureaucrat has vision,
goals that break down the vision, plans on how to achieve each goal, and
milestones which indicate whether the plan is proceeding.</p>
<p>Perspectives to consider when assessing change include what the
situation is, what the situation could be, and what the situation looks
like from different stakeholders.</p>
<p>Confounding your ability to improve the organization, there are
people around you who have conflicting visions or no vision. There are
different views on whether something is actually a problem, different
prioritizations, and different approaches to addressing problems.</p>
<p>A trade-off to consider is that having niche impact is easier than
broad change. There’s also a trade-off of the quick fix versus more
robust solutions.</p>
<p>For a given structural problem in an organization, options include
technical solutions, changing policy, or changing cultural norms of
participants.</p>
<p>determine social/political/technical impediments.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Before starting a new effort, check to see whether this
has been tackled before. Learn the history of the problem. Why hasn’t
this been solved?</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Query your first and second order social network.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: get feedback early before polishing</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: advertise the result.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: hear criticism and respond</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: leverage both social networks and bureaucratic
processes.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Professional respect (for what the other person knows)
and professional curiosity (for what you don’t know)<br />
Example: Getting approval from multiple overseers in different
hierarchies is hard. Often different objectives and incentives.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Use social recommendations to identify relevant
individuals. Leverage the trust already in their social network by
starting with “Person A recommended I talk to you about X."</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Sit in on meetings, listen to topics, see who is
talking, who is attending. After the meeting talk to individuals about
the meeting. Set up one-on-one informal discussions. Keep the first
conversation brief - 10 or 15 minutes. Your body language should
indicate engagement and interest. “Who else would you recommend talking
to?" is the last question in the first conversation.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Consensus doesn’t mean everyone agrees on the problem,
the remedy, or the approach, or who’s taking the action. Consensus in a
bureaucracy means people aren’t going to resist the change.</p>
<h3 id="measuring-bureaucratic-maturity-of-bureaucrats">Measuring
Bureaucratic Maturity of Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic maturity of bureaucrats in an organization can be broken
into three behaviors:</p>
<p>The first and most wide spread behavior is to observe a problem and
then complain about the situation. This indicates awareness of the
environment but no creativity regarding what to do about the
problems.</p>
<p>The second, less common behavior, is to observe a problem and
recognize the situation as an opportunity. This requires creativity and
reframing.</p>
<p>The third behavior is to observe a problem and then nudge the
situation towards a vision. The nudges could be through either direct
action or by influencing others.</p>
<p>An individual bureaucrat can exhibit one or more of these behaviors.
That is, being capable of the third behavior does not mean the person
lacks the ability to complain on other topics.</p>
<p>There is not a specific amount of experience within the organization
needed to arrive at any of these three paradigms. A holistic
understanding of the system certainly helps.</p>
<p>The “vision" of the third behavior could be in the form of a
long-term (temporally distant) outcome, or the vision could be of
immediate multi-party cooperation.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-other-bureaucrats">Working with other
Bureaucrats<span id="sec:working-with-other-bureaucrats"

<p>Delegation of tasks Asking for help Seeking input Offering to help
Offering input Understand what someone else is priorities are and why
those are priorities</p>
<p>These all directly impact your reputation; see § <a

data-reference="sec:reputation">[sec:reputation]</a>.</p>
<p>enumerate tropes to figure how to respond</p>
<p>Solo work may be more emotionally rewarding due to fewer external
constraints, but the cost is complexity and scope being limited to the
skills of the individual.</p>
<p>Working with others allows you to occasionally accomplish complex
results beyond your own skills or your own bandwidth in spite of
collaborators not being under your control. How? Through persuasion.</p>
<p>The challenge of collaboration is to multiply productivity rather
than merely sum the output of a set of individuals.</p>
<p>inside an organization, cooperation/coordination is not held together
by internal contracts or even service level agreements. What holds the
organization together? Force of will of participants.</p>
<p>two networks: formal an informal</p>
<h3 id="not-my-job-task-scope">Not my job: task scope</h3>
<p>If I ask someone for help on a task that benefits the team, that
person might respond that the task is “not my job" and time spent on
tasks like that “gets in the way" of their progress. The interesting
(emotionally rewarding) work is not that task.</p>
<p>The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>will not get them promoted</p></li>
<li><p>scope of their job and their expertise does not include the
task</p></li>
<li><p>they don’t know how to do the task and they don’t want to
learn</p></li>

<p>In any case, the individual’s “progress" is not aligned with the
success of the team.</p>
<h3 id="building-managing-and-spending-reputation">Building, Managing,
and Spending Reputation<span id="sec:reputation"

<p>Organizations have reputations externally. Internal-to-the-org there
is cultural norms.</p>
<p>Building reputation through multiple small wins or larger risk on
bigger bets</p>
<p>Relation between Reputation and Brand and Political Capital? Same
thing?</p>
<p>How does an individual create and accumulate political capital? What
does political capital mean with respect to teams?</p>
<p>Reputation matters for influence. How other people perceive you
impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek out your help or
input.</p>
<p>Your reputation is actively changing based on your activities and
communication – both your communication and the stories others tell
about you.</p>
<p>Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to the
stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation
requires engaging people and generating evidence.</p>
<p>Reputation is set whenever and where ever you are observed, or
artifacts are associated with you. What you wear, when you show up, how
your emails appear, body posture in meetings.</p>
<p>Reputation is perception of the person the bureaucrat is engaging
with. What does that person think of you?</p>
<p>Ideally that would be a function of their technical skill, ability to
collaborate with other people, the strength of their network,
creativity. None of this matters if the person you’re engaging with
doesn’t know those things.</p>
<p>Based on your reputation, what trust does that person have?</p>
<p>To spend reputation is to bend the rules.</p>
<p>Spending reputation means taking risk that involve other people</p>
<p>Build reputation by doing useful things that are visible to other
people</p>
<h3 id="teams-as-a-subdivsion-of-an-organization">Teams as a subdivsion
of an Organization</h3>
<p>In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers
available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige,
products (output)</p>
<h3 id="leveraging-expertise">Leveraging Expertise</h3>
<p><strong>For experts looking to help non-expert decision
makers</strong></p>
<p>non-experts think and speak less precisely</p>
<p>You, the expert, may not win any debates based on number of years of
experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However,
expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from.</p>
<p>Identify which party (you, the expert, or the audience) has broader
diversity of situations.</p>
<p>respect and account for the expertise of the audience (especially
when they work in a different field). Acknowledge your own limits.</p>
<p>Don’t rely completely on expertise as a single dimensional relation.
Find ways to relate personally to audience members. They will need to
build trust in you personally.</p>
<p>Facilitate the audience setting the goals. They should be able to
identify how success is defined.</p>
<p>Identify strengths your audience has and build on those.</p>
<p>You don’t have to teach a group all-at-once. One-on-one teaching is
more customizable, and the audience may feel less worried about asking
dumb questions.</p>
<p>Once you’ve taught more than one person, they can help each other
translate the skill.</p>
<p><strong>For non-experts looking for expertise</strong></p>
<p>Experts may lack experience communicating their knowledge.</p>
<p>Experts are cautious to include caveats and limitations</p>
<p>Translation process is necessary from "here’s what’s known in
general" + "situation specific facts" to "plan of (in)action" and what’s
realistic with what confidence.</p>
<p>Experts straying outside their expertise are dangerous because the
boundary may not be clear to the audience.</p>
<p>How to recruit an advisor if you don’t have expertise yourself:
triangulate. Seek guidance from your existing social network. Advisor
should be opinionated (not meek) but adaptive to new information.</p>
<h3 id="does-anyone-want-to-volunteer">Does anyone want to
volunteer?</h3>
<p>Meeting facilitator asking, "Does anyone want to volunteer for this
task?" to a group will most often be met by silence. The lack of
engagement can be addressed by not asking for volunteers. The outcome
can be higher engagement with the following tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask each person whether they are attending to observe or to
volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person how much time they are willing to volunteer.
Responses could be 0, or 1 hour (non-recurring), or 1 hour per month, or
something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what their goals in the interaction are. It is
usually generic ("I want the group to succeed.") but it can be narrow,
in which case that gives you something to focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what they are good at and what skills they have.
Are they good with personal interaction? Writing? Computers?
Coordinating? Logistics? Fund raising? Making phone calls?</p></li>
<li><p>From the inventory of tasks, are there any that fit both the
skills and time? Can the task be scoped to fit the time? If there are
multiple candidate tasks for a volunteer, let them pick the task. (If
there is no existing task that aligns with their skills, do not create
work to be assigned.)</p></li>
<li><p>If there are other volunteer working the same tasks, put them in
contact with the other participants</p></li>
<li><p>Give the volunteer a deadline for the task. The deadline should
not be arbitrary – the deadline should be based on the dependent
follow-on tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the volunteer is willing to commit the time to
complete the tasks by the deadline</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a check-in with the volunteer before the task deadline
to review progress</p></li>
<li><p>To create accountability among multiple volunteers, hold a group
review to explain how each participant’s work contributes to the goals
and how work done by one person enables the next task done by someone
else. (Enumerate the dependency graph; include deadlines.)</p></li>

<p>When two independently-governed processes interact, there can be

to another process. Submitting the receipt shifts the accountability and
justification burden to the accepting bureaucrat.</p>
<p>I have dental insurance. I visited the dentist December 2 and one of
the procedures during a routine cleaning was “bitewing x-rays." This
procedure is covered by my insurance, so I was surprised when I received
a bill for it from my dentist.</p>
<p>I called my dentist and they explained that the dental insurance had
declined to pay for the procedure. I called the insurance company Jan 3
and they confirmed that the procedure was covered by my policy. Every
time I call the insurance provider I have to provide my SSN, DoB, and
Zip twice – once to the automated system, a second time to the person I
talk with. The insurance company apparently had made a mistake and said
they would cover the cost of the procedure. I followed up with my
dentist and explained the situation.</p>
<p>I called the dentist to see if they had received payment yet. They
had not, so I called the dental insurance provider again Feb 6 and 8.
Feb 8 the insurance company said they would process the payment within
7-10 business days. I called again Feb 20 and the claim hadn’t been
initiated within the insurance company. I spoke to the supervisor and
she said she would personally visit the claims office within the
insurance company.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the dentist, they are seeking money for the
service they provided me.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the insurance company, delaying payment on a
claim makes good financial sense – the policy holder is likely to just
pay the balance in order to avoid going to court with the dentist.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the question is whether chasing this issue makes
financial sense. I think of my hourly rate as <span

would have been better to pay out of pocket. Effectively I’m devaluing
my time. The emotional stress and thought-cycles expended are also
relevant, though harder to quantify.</p>

<p>The Laffer curve is a claim in economics that there is a relation
between government tax rates and the revenue from taxes collected. The
relation, based on Rolle’s theorem, says that between a tax rate of
0</p>
<p>While the mathematical statement may be provable, the use in
economics seems hand-wavy. In this post, I’ll extend that hand-waviness
to a different domain: bureaucratic processes in organizations. The
relation to the Laffer curve is that bureaucratic processes a tax on
productivity.</p>
<h3 id="tactic-approval-forgiveness-opposition">Tactic: Approval,
Forgiveness, Opposition</h3>
<p>A common bureaucratic task is consensus regarding action or expending
resources. There are distinct options about how to get that
consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval before taking action. This approach incurs both
providing justification and waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness after taking action. Often viewed as being in
contrast to seeking approval. Less delay, and usually works if things go
well or if no one notices.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Intent with deadline for response. The window for
response should be sufficient to actually allow feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition before taking action. This is a different
framing from approval or forgiveness. It decreases the risk the approver
has to take on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p>Most organization default to an approval-based processes. Each new
idea needs to be signed off as approved by a sequential list of
bureaucrats. The sequence (not concurrent) process may be known in
advance, or it may be ad hoc if the request is novel.</p>
<p>Relying on approval is harmful to innovation because sign-off by each
bureaucrat is interpeted as “I am 100% in agreement with this.” Each
stakeholder has to bless innovation and tie their reputation to the
outcome.</p>
<p>The “I won’t stop this” (soliciting opposition) is a more useful
paradigm. With the consensus process language changed to "I won’t stop
this," then the bureaucrat can avoid taking responsibility for the idea
and therefore are not tying their reputation to the result.</p>

environment the organization exists in is not static. With that premise,
why are static processes that are not robust to change created in the
first place? Answer: so policy creators can point to an effort and avoid
looking neglectful.</p>
<p>Creating robust processes that are dynamic takes more investment.
First, the underlying process must be documented. What is expected to
happen? Who are the stakeholders? This logic is what is fragile to
change. Second, document assumptions used in the process. If the
assumptions are invalidated, then the process is broken and needs to be
discarded or at least revised.</p>
<p>The problem is that even when the process is documented and
assumptions enumerated, they may not be checked to see if revision is
necessary. Measurements need to be periodically taken to see if the
assumptions are still applicable. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision">Sunset
provisions</a> have a similar intent of forcing renewal.</p>
<p>A more quantitative approach is to tie a process to a cost/benefit
model. The benefit to implementing a process comes at some cost. If the
assumptions of the process can be tied to a cost/benefit model, then we
can determine whether the process is worth implementing. Periodic
measurements are needed to update the cost/benefit model and determine
whether the process is effective.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucratic-debt">Bureaucratic Debt<span
id="sec:bureaucratic_debt" label="sec:bureaucratic_debt"></span></h3>
<p>Suppose a process is implemented now, and later found to be
ineffective. Some work is needed to revise the process and hopefully
improve effectiveness. <span data-acronym-label="bureaucratic debt"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucratic debt</span> is the cost
of that work needed to change a process. The bureaucratic debt is caused
by choosing an easy solution now (with limited information or
insufficient resources) instead of using a better approach that would
take longer to design and implement.</p>
<p>The purpose of defining this concept is to capture the otherwise
unaccounted work resulting from decisions.</p>
<p>Decisions occur in a resource constrained environment (e.g.,
insufficient time, money, labor). Each decision made results in options
that are not explored. Some of these missed opportunities are associated
with short-term versus long-term trade-offs of costs.</p>
<p>These opportunity costs (what the organization doesn’t do) alters
which future decisions become available.</p>
<p>Getting information (measurement) and analysis are costly in terms of
money, time, skill, and labor.</p>
<p>Once the concept of bureaucratic debt is recognized, the question is
how to track it.</p>
<p>To document bureaucratic debt, we need to capture decisions as they
are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what is the decision to be made?</p></li>
<li><p>when the decision was identified?</p></li>
<li><p>when the decision was made?</p></li>
<li><p>who made the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>what options were identified?</p></li>
<li><p>which option was chosen?</p></li>
<li><p>what that option was chosen over the other options</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of documenting decisions is to enable both aversion to
bad decisions and attraction to good decisions. Without documenting
decisions, there is no transparency, accountability, or historical
ability to track dependencies.</p>
<p>The documentation of decisions needs to be disseminated to
stakeholders. This should occur as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>The scale of decision impact determines the level of documentation.
"Do I choose pencil or pen?" incurs negligible bureaucratic debt;
therefore the documentation needed is also negligible. Projecting impact
of decisions is a subjective prediction.</p>
<p>Similarities of technical debt and bureaucratic debt. In developing
software, there are three artifacts: the software, documentation on how
to use the software, and documentation on why to use the software. The
two distinct types of documentation are typically combined in one
document. Each of these three artifacts are independent. The
ramification of this is that each artifact can be created independently,
and it takes work to maintain synchronization of the artifacts.</p>
<p>Similarly for a bureaucracy, there is the processes and policies
which get applied to customers, the documentation of what those
processes and policies are, and guidance on when the processes and
policies should be applied. As with technical debt, these three aspects
are independent.</p>

<p>Coordination among participants is one way to break the <a

times and skill; not everyone is willing to invest in communication that

<h3 id="communication-preferences">Communication Preferences</h3>
<p>There are typically multiple communication channels available between
bureaucrats in an organization. Rather than focus on specific
implementations using specific technologies, consider two variables. The
first variable is asynchronous versus synchronous. Examples of
asynchronous communication channels include voice mail, email, web
forums, web sites, calendars. Synchronous options include phone calls,
video calls, in-person, text-based chat like IRC or Slack. The
distinction between these can be blurry, like if someone immediately
replies to your (asynchronous) email. The second variable is a set of
categories: voice (e.g., phone), text (e.g., website, web forums,
calendars), video (e.g., calls), and in-person.</p>
<p>The relevance to a bureaucrat of identifying these channels is to
know which channel is preferred for what purpose. To be an effective
bureaucrat there are reciprocal actions. First, you should list your own
preferences so that people know how best to engage with you. Second, you
should learn and then leverage the preferences of individuals you
collaborate with.</p>
<p>As an example of knowing your own behaviors, do you keep your
calendar up-to-date? Or is your calendar irrelevant? Is that preference
stated explicitly to the people who might reference your calendar? Is
your calendar visible to your coworkers?</p>
<p>Text chat is useful for asynchronous interrupts. Text chats are
better than stopping by in person or calling on the phone since
in-person drive-bys and phone calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking
about or discussing. The purpose of the text chat is either a reminder
or seeking a convenient time to talk.</p>
<p>Email is useful for notifications or questions or setting up
logistics. If I don’t respond to a question or request for action within
2 days, please send a reminder.</p>
<p>Video calls are my preferred method for group meetings. Group
meetings via video call scheduled in advance on my calendar are best.
Impromptu video calls are acceptable but as interruptive as a phone
call.</p>
<p>In-person discussions are my preferred method for one-on-one
discussions. Stopping by my desk without an appointment interrupts
whatever I’m thinking about. If a calendar invitation is inconvenient, a
text chat confirming my availability prior to the in-person discussion
is helpful.</p>
<p>Phone is useful when the caller is unable to be present in-person.
Phone, being voice-only, is inferior to video calls. Unscheduled phone
calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking about. I’ve intentionally disabled
voicemail.</p>
<p>Status updates in electronic issue trackers or wikis or forums are
best (rather than email-only). Notifying in text chat or email that a
wiki page or issue is updated is helpful but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Given all those caveats, I prefer communication in any form at any
time over surprises.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether you should communicate, default to
communicating. If you’re not sure whether communication would interrupt
something, check my calendar and then communicate. If it’s urgent or
blocking progress, ignore my calendar.</p>
<p>Know when to switch communication channels. When to start in one
channel and then escalate. Text to phone to in person</p>

<p>Being transparent means "here’s what is happening"</p>
<p>Being vulnerable means "here’s why that’s happening or what might
happen"</p>
<h3 id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social and Bureaucratic
interactions</h3>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social interaction example</em>: “Did you see the game on TV
last night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting
tickets for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bureaucratic interaction example</em>: “You’ll need to get
approval from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their
review. Then talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>To make invisible work and invisible bureaucracy visible, document
the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s "culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social/visible bureaucracy/invisible bureaucracy is a characterization
of the culture. There are norms associated with each of these three
categories.</p>
<h3 id="communication-techniques">Communication techniques</h3>

feeling with sufficient accuracy, but with imprecise language. As a
result, there’s no specific action.</p>
<p>Because platitudes result in a "feel good" conclusion, the
conversation participants may feel more bonded. However, that bond is
shallow.</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="eliminate-crosstalk">Eliminate crosstalk</h3>
<p>Crosstalk is motivated by limited time available to communicate
inspired by something someone else said responding to something someone
else said Typically manifests as popcorn style stories based on
experience. Intended as wisdom for self-validation by others in our
community.</p>
<p>Crosstalk indicates engagement and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Crosstalk is dependent on the level of aggressiveness of
participants.</p>
<p>Crosstalk has four roles and a minimum of two people participating:
discussion facilitator original speaker interrupter other meeting
participants During crosstalk, the discussion facilitator loses control
of the interaction to the interrupter. The original speaker probably
feels annoyed at being interrupted. The audience probably feels
frustrated because where to focus has become unclear. This leads to a
loss of focus.</p>
<p>Bystander intervention for out-of-control meeting: raise your hand.
This reverts focus back to the discussion facilitator.</p>

<p>If I read email to figure out the purpose of the email, that will
help me determine what action and response are relevant.</p>
<p>Whether I am the only recipient or on of many receivers can change
the intent of the email, and whether I’m in the "to" or "cc" field
matters. Unfortunately, "to" versus "cc" are not reliable indicators
since email senders do not reliably conform to the expected use.</p>
<p>This categorization of text within emails is a useful natural
language processing challenge for machine learning. Gmail already does
some of this with identifying meeting logistics, providing reminders to
follow-up, and providing reply snippets. A browser plug-in that
differentiates the various purposes of text could help readers determine
relevant actions and responses.</p>
<h4 id="survey-stakeholders">Survey stakeholders</h4>
<p>Suppose you are a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace
Corps</a> worker in Africa. You show up and the village doesn’t have
easy access to clean water. Villagers walk a long ways in dangerous
areas for dirty, unsafe water. This is a very obvious problem and all
the villagers agree that they don’t have good water and that this
problem should be fixed.</p>
<p>Implementing the solution would take about a week - get the equipment
to the village, drill a well, build a pump.</p>
<p>You could take additional time and involve the villagers in this
project. They could participate in getting the equipment, which should
lead to a sense of ownership. But then when the equipment shows up, they
don’t take action to drill the well. If the well is drilled, it soon
falls into disrepair and the villagers are back to doing things they way
they used to. What happened?</p>
<p>The villagers don’t see access to clean water as the most significant
issue. You came in and imposed your view of what the problem is and how
to fix it. When you impose your view of what the problem is, the
solution won’t be adopted by villagers because they don’t prioritize it.
It is better to survey the community to see how they operate. What do
they think the problems are? Both leadership and the community members
need to provide priorities.</p>
<p>This issue is exacerbated if you come to the village as a
representative of a company providing wells. You are biased when you
ask, “Do you have any problems?"</p>
<p>Of course the villagers have water problems which could be fixed with
better wells. However, when you get into the details of placing or
improving a well, they lose interest. What the community really wants is
free installation, zero maintenance, easy to use, and no operational
costs. That would improve their life.</p>
<p>When you say there’s cost (both initial investment of capital and
then operations/maintenance) and a learning curve associated with the
solution, then the user’s interest wanes – you are presenting another
cost/benefit ratio for them to evaluate. Then they ask "Can we get by
without the well?" Yes, they don’t need the well – they’ve survived
without it.</p>
<p>Novel solutions (in this example, drilling a well and installing a
pump) have have barriers to adoption. Two barriers are the current
priorities of the community and the incumbent solution/processes.</p>
<p>If there are problems with higher priority, the community will delay
implementing your solution. That’s fine if the higher-ranked priorities
are bounded, but they are often not. An example of this is the
following: Suppose a person has three tasks, and you introduce a
solution which is a fourth task. If the first task is "go from point A
to point B," then that task will eventually be eliminated and there will
be three remaining. If the second task is "secure your village," that is
an unbounded task. The person won’t get to or won’t prioritize your
low-ranked task.</p>
<p>How will your solution impact their higher-ranked priorities?</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Summary of what action should be carried out</strong><br />
As the outsider, you should help the community enumerate and document
all of the problems they identify. Then you can help enumerate and
document how the problems are related (dependencies). Only then can you
help the community identify and document the root causes.</p>
<p>If the solution you, the outsider, identified really is the root
cause, then the community will arrive at that independently. If that is
the case, then you can enable them to implement a solution which
addresses the root causes. The community will then have a sense of
ownership.</p>
<h3 id="friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Friction between

<h1 id="last-chapter">Last chapter</h1>
<p>It is possible to operate within a bureaucracy and entirely focus on
“just do the job.” It is also possible to do your job and understand the
role of engaging with other people – peer bureaucrats, supervisors, and
subjects. In this book a third option of accounting for emergent
phenomena has been argued for.</p>
<p>Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn’t mean you can ignore
personalities of individuals. Bureaucracy as a skill is in addition to
being a good person, being an effective member of a team, being a good
project manager, having technical skills, etc. The distinction from
those is that a bureaucrat understands the complications and constraints
of their environment and then can more effectively operate within those
conditions.</p>
<p>Summary of the "how to be more effective" actions. Accept that the
narrow scope of your role (which hopefully leverages your
education/training) does not capture all relevant aspects of your
job.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Need to be able to participate or facilitate meetings. This means
agenda, providing rules on interaction (raising hands), taking notes,
and follow-up.</p></li>
<li><p>Focused education on written communication (emails, chat,
reports) that empathizes with reader, captures relevant context,
concise, clearly worded,</p></li>
<li><p>project management: have a vision, make a plan, all while
building consensus</p></li>
<li><p>negotiation</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audience-analysis">Audience Analysis</h2>
<p>Primary audience for this book is self-identified novice bureaucrats
and people planning to work in a bureaucracy. Value of this book is
advice beyond “be a good person” and specific to the role of a
bureaucrat (and not project manager/team lead/software developer).</p>
<p>Secondary audience is white collar workers who have experience
working in a bureaucracy and are just realizing they are bureaucrats.
This audience will find some of the information to be already known.</p>
<p>Tertiary audience is non-bureaucrats who want to better understand
why bureaucratic systems are challenging. Americans consider themselves
"individuals" and neglect the necessary integration of operating within
a society. This book won’t be a popular best seller, but it is intended
for a lay audience and does not assume prior academic exposure to the
topic.</p>
<p>Lastly, researchers of bureaucracy. This book is not a theoretical
systemic analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This encyclopedic reference/text provides an analysis of the basic
issues and major aspects of bureaucracy, bureaucratic politics and
administrative theory, public policy, and public administration in
historical and contemporary perspectives. Examining theoretical,
philosophical, and empirical interpretations, as well as the intricate
position of bureaucracy in government, politics, national development,
international relations, and a host of other institutions, the book
focuses on the multifunctional role of public bureaucracies in societies
with various socioeconomic, political, cultural, and ideological
orientations and covers a wide range of processes and subjects.<a

author’s assessment: written by an anthropologist; gives an outsider’s
view and the experiences of a subject of bureaucrats. Introduction gives
a good history of modern bureaucracy.</p>
<p>This book is comprised of an introduction, three chapters, and an
Appendix.</p>
<p>In the introduction Graeber proposes his “Iron Law of
Liberalism”,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any market reform, any government initiative intended to reduce red
tape and promote market forces will have the ultimate effect of
increasing the total number of regulations, the total amount of
paperwork, and the total number of bureaucrats the government
employs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graeber claims working-class Americans see government as comprised of
politicians and bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The options for decision making are bureaucracy and the market.</p>

author’s assessment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Street-level bureaucracy concerns a vital part of the ways in which
public policy programs are implemented, particularly through the
relationship between public officials and individual citizens.
Addressing the state of the art and providing a systematic exploration
of the theoretical and methodological issues at stake, this Research
Handbook is a crucial contribution to the analysis of public policy from
the perspective of the ground floor of government.</p>
<p>The Research Handbook covers theoretical themes in current research
such as institutional theory, social inequality, national culture,
discrimination and representation, digitalization, and accountability.
Analysing the role of teachers, police officers and other street-level
bureaucrats, chapters explore how these individuals implement policies
through their daily contact with citizens. Further sections investigate
the methodological tools for research, as well as the future challenges
facing the area. Peter Hupe concludes with lessons for the study of
street-level bureaucracy and a significant research agenda for the
topic.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"

<p>Intended audience: novice bureaucrats starts their public service
career</p>
<p>author has read this book: yes<br />

author’s assessment: terrible; avoid this book!</p>
<p>As a government bureaucrat, I wanted to see if this book could be
useful for helping new members of my organization. This book is not
appropriate for that use, and the book contains bad advice. Some of the
views are harmful.</p>
<p>In a paragraph about communicating with the public on page 51, the
author provides a racist observation: "If the person you are talking to
is Asian, and they are nodding when they say yes, assume they don’t have
the slightest idea of what you’re saying, but are too polite to tell
you."</p>
<p>In the chapter on education, on page 12 the author’s advice is, "To
be a good bureaucrat you should become computer literate, as opposed to
becoming computer stupid. This is true for any career field you choose.
Almost all job applications are submitted on the computer. Office
E-Mails have replaced typed memorandums."</p>
<p>This book was published in 2015, so this content is jarring from the
perspective of 2022. I suspect part of the cause is that author is old;
the author bio mentions a 48 year career, which means he was probably 70
at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Setting aside the bad advice and harm in this book, the author’s view
is that a bureaucrat is a government employee. The author advocates
working in Human Resources or a budget office since those are stable
jobs. The book does contain some valid observations about life as a
bureaucrat; however, the valid insights are outweighed by the number and
importance of incorrect explanations.</p>
<p>The book appears to based wholly on the author’s experience. No
citations to research and no surveys are mentioned. Only two other
publications are cited (Webster’s dictionary for definitions, and the
book "Rules for Radicals"). The advice is written to be generic to
modern (American) bureaucrats.</p>
<p>The book is self-published. There are a few minor errors (missing
periods, extra periods) but not so many as to be disruptive to reading
the content.</p>
