<p>Thank you to my coworkers. Our interactions taught me how to be a
better bureaucrat.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>If you have a negative impression of bureaucracy, I have bad news for
you: bureaucracy is vital to society. The good news is that you can
learn to skillfully navigate bureaucracy. A skilled bureaucrat is more
effective and enhances the organization they are part of.</p>
<p>The framing of how you think about bureaucracy shapes what action you
think is relevant for modifying your environment. If your mental model
is not consistent with how bureaucracy works then your actions are
likely to be wasted effort tackling irrelevant aspects. If your
assumptions are wrong about how the system of bureaucracy works, then
you will be trying to convert the system to meet your incorrect
expectations. A more accurate model of bureaucracy allows you to be more
effective and your changes to the system are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Having a precise definition of bureaucracy enables a clearer
discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Bureaucracy is a system for distributing
shared resources, whether tangible or expertise, by subjective decision
making of individual people using a distributed knowledge and
distributed decision making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The concepts and techniques in this book are derived from this
definition. For more exploration of this definition, see §<a
href="#sec:define_bureaucracy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:define_bureaucracy">[sec:define_bureaucracy]</a>.</p>
<p>As a quick example of how this definition is distinct from
conventional definitions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, I view government as an instance of
bureaucracy; bureaucracy is not limited to government.</p>
<p>Reasoning about the systems of bureaucracy is an accessible topic for
everyone because we each have personal experience. For example, one can
argue that the systems of bureaucracy that we operate within is broken:
participants are harmed and there is inequality. The counterargument is
that observed bureaucratic behavior is how the system was designed to
operate. There is a third argument: bureaucratic systems operate in a
degraded mode (compared to what is possible). In this book I set aside
the macro-scale behaviors of bureaucracy like the three arguments above
and focus on the human-scale interactions that drive bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The difficulties of bureaucracy are central to large societies that
depend on complex interactions of many people. The challenge of
bureaucracy is widespread across a variety of governments in different
societies, and bureaucracy is durable – it has existed for hundreds if
not thousands of years. Therefore, tackling the challenge of bureaucracy
is exciting (there are many potential improvements) and crucial. Being
an effective bureaucrat is important because bureaucracy can be a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication">force
multiplier</a> beyond what one person could accomplish on their own.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are curious about the complex world we
live in, or you are thinking about how to productively contribute to
society, or you want impactful employment, or your job is not what you
expected. If you’re wondering why innovation is hard within a
bureaucratic organization, this guidebook is intended to help understand
what the challenges are. Understanding the challenges means you can
design ideas that are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Every person in society is a participant in bureaucracy. The purpose
of this book is to decrease the surprise of that experience and better
arm you emotionally and intellectually for the toil of being a
bureaucrat. With focused reflection and a good guidebook, you can
improve your skills as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Understanding bureaucracy spans academic disciplines - <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology">sociology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_behavior">organizational
dynamics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration">public
administration</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science">political
science</a>. Most bureaucrats have no formal training in any of these
domains. This book is not written from the academic perspective; it is a
guidebook to be read by bureaucrats and written by a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>This book is not a defense of bureaucracy, nor is it intended to
disparage bureaucrats or the system of bureaucracy. Instead, the intent
of this book is to serve as a guide to bureaucracy-as-it-is.</p>
<p>This book does not focus on leadership, managing a team, being a team
member, planning, time management, project management, advancing your
career, or self-improvement. In the process of being a better bureaucrat
some lessons may apply in those domains.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t address personal stress caused by bureaucracy, how
to decrease stress, or how to balance the activities of work and
life-outside-work.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t focus on citizens, political policy makers,
oversight (e.g., Congress – state or federal), competing organizations,
contracts, the budget of an organization, fines and other regulatory
punishments resulting from bureaucracy, policy enforcement, specific
policies and regulations, formal arbitration or judicial resolution of
disputes. For observations on those topics, see Wilson’s
Bureaucracy <span class="citation" data-cites="1991_Wilson">(J. Q.
Wilson 1991)</span>.</p>
<p>This book doesn’t address discrimination or harassment. I ignore
differences of experience based on the race, gender, or socioeconomic
status. This book doesn’t address bad coworkers, abusive bosses,
psychological defects of individuals, or malicious intent. I assume no
traitors, spies, or saboteurs. I do not address <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">dark patterns</a>;
issues like lying, bribery <span class="citation"
data-cites="2021_Ang">(Ang 2021)</span>, and criminal behavior are not
discussed. All these aspects happen whenever people interact; the
challenges are not specific to bureaucracy. In this book I assume you
are honest, and that other people are honest. I assume bureaucrats
strive for fairness, though the particular definition of fairness may
vary from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. Even with all these simplifying
assumptions the complexities of bureaucracy arise. In this context of
benign bureaucracy, guidance on how to be an effective bureaucrat is
provided.</p>
<p>As a result of reading this book, you will be better able to
recognize and navigate complex professional environments, both within
your career and outside of work. The perspectives offered in this book
can benefit you directly, whether by promotion of rank or title,
increase in pay, successful completion of a project, or through
decreased stress derive from improved understanding how the world
operates. Being a more effective bureaucrat can also positively impact
the causes you care about and the people you engage with.</p>
<p>The negative connotation of bureaucracy may lead you to reject the
label of bureaucrat. Whether you intentionally reject the label or
simply do not recognize that you are bureaucrat, self-recognition of
your status matters. How you behave and what you think your
responsibilities are depend on how you label yourself. If you don’t
think of yourself as a bureaucrat, then you won’t be able to distinguish
what is your own fault, what is the fault of your coworkers, what is the
fault of management, and what is intrinsic to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Even people who are smart (e.g., they know history, they have
memorized capital cities, they can do math) can struggle when faced with
complex large-scale distributed systems comprised of humans. Thinking
about complex large-scale systems is not part of the standard
conventional education curriculum. This book will help you learn about
bureaucracy and lead to an increased ability to identify patterns and
apply relevant techniques.</p>
<p>Everyone is a bureaucrat because there are few alternatives to
bureaucracy for a society. Gaining skills in navigating bureaucracy are
helpful both for your own happiness and the well-being of a functioning
society.</p>
<p>Hoping that modern technology will eliminate or reduce bureaucracy is
not a solution. Automation and computers merely obfuscate processes and
make negotiation more challenging. Even with faster decisions and fewer
humans, there is still reliance on humans to make decisions and design
processes.</p>
<p>Simplifying interactions with other people merely as human relations
is an easier perspective compared to considering bureaucracy as a
complex system. The simplified view misses emergent phenomena and
mischaracterizes the situation. As a result your effectiveness is
decreased.</p>
<p>Nothing in this book is domain specific, nothing is tied to
engineering of products, and nothing is applicable solely in science
research or policy development. While this material is intended to be
timeless and generic, it is culturally specific to the United States of
America in the early twenty first century.</p>
<p>This material is based on personal experience, reading published
materials, and anecdotes from other people. No surveys were taken to
support the claims made. No <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment">double blind</a>
experiments were conducted.</p>
<p>Reading this book front-to-back is the default option, but not
essential. The dependencies of topics are not linear; see Fig. <a

defines bureaucracy and associated terminology for specific roles.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-bureaucracy">What is bureaucracy?<span
id="sec:define_bureaucracy" label="sec:define_bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>While you may know it when you see or experience bureaucracy, for
this book definitions are useful.</p>
<p><span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> involves creation
and execution of <span data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">policys</span>. Creating and carrying
out policies usually involves multiple people, with each person having a
specialized roles. Task scalability, complexity, or latency drive
multiple people to form a hierarchical organization. The organization
has control over the disbursement of resources relevant to the society
the organization operates within, or administers a policy within that
society. Resources managed by the organization are either tangible
(e.g., water, air, land) or expertise.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is not limited to government. Non-profit organizations,
volunteer groups, commercial companies, and even small teams of people
can invoke bureaucratic tendencies. The existence of bureaucracy is
independent of an organization’s purpose. Carrying out someone else’s
subjectively defined policy will require you to make your own subjective
decisions regarding execution and enforcement.</p>
<p> <br />
With bureaucracy defined, distinct roles can be identified. A
bureaucracy typically involves a policy creator, a policy enforcer, and
the person upon whom policy is inflicted. In the context of government,
the policy creator can be either a politician or a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>An organization comprised of bureaucrats is a <span
data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span>. The protagonist
within a bureaucracy is the <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> – the person who is
a member of an organization and is responsible for subjective
implementation of policy for the organization. The person that a
bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on a <span
data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>. Depending on context,
a subject may be a student (when the bureaucrat is a teacher) or a
subject may be a citizen if the bureaucrat is a police officer or
government official. Sometimes a bureaucrat’s decisions are inflicted on
other bureaucrats-as-subjects, such as when a Chief of Police creates
guidelines for police in their district, or when a senior diplomat sets
policy for embassy employees.</p>
<p>A <span data-acronym-label="bureaucrat"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucrat</span> is a person
subjectively interpreting policies on behalf of an organization and has
discretionary enforcement. The bureaucrat’s purpose is to facilitate
coordination of stakeholders by applying specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>Let’s break that down piece-by-piece. First, “subjective
interpretation” means there is a person making a decision about how to
do something. The subjectivity arises from different reasons one person
might choose an option over a competing option. A <span
data-acronym-label="policy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">policy</span> is a set of actions in
a given circumstance. An <span data-acronym-label="organization"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">organization</span> is the collection
of people for who the policy is made. Discretionary enforcement means
the person is choosing how to apply the policy in the specific
circumstances. Facilitating coordination means bureaucracy is about
getting multiple people (or sometimes a person at different instances in
time) to work together. The stakeholders are people who care about the
application of the action in each circumstance. That’s still pretty
dense, so the rest of the book is spent expanding the nuances and
implications of this definition.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is neither good nor bad. Bureaucracy is not tied to
politics, nor is bureaucracy specific to an institution (corporations,
governments, academics). The definition of bureaucracy used in this book
is independent of government. Bureaucracy is not defined to be
efficient; nor does it have to be inefficient. Bureaucracy is not
restricted to paperwork, record keeping, quantification, or gathering
metrics. Nothing in this definition involves paperwork or an office
building. Definitions that limit the concept of bureaucracy to specific
contexts result in a decreased ability to describe complex large-scale
human organizations.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is about delegation of control, communication, decision
making, coordination, and processes. Bureaucracy relies on
negotiation.</p>
<p>A critical aspect of bureaucracy is that everything is made up,
specifically by other humans. The consequence is that everything is
negotiable. You (in the role of either a subject or a bureaucrat) need
to know both who to negotiate with and how to negotiate the desired
changes. My claim that bureaucracy is made up is in contrast to actual
rules – the mathematical physics that describe nature. Everything in
your environment is either naturally occurring macroscopic emergent
phenomena (e.g., chemistry, biology) or humans making up labels and
norms. Distinguishing the two is critical to knowing what you can change
and what you have to operate within.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises when there is no common objectively quantifiable
feedback mechanism for individual participants in the organization. This
aspect is why governments, schools, and prisons are characterized as
bureaucratic. The military doesn’t rank soldiers by “number of enemies
killed” and is bureaucratic. Even profit-driven commercial organizations
are bureaucratic when the impacts of individual employees are not
coupled to the metrics of profit.</p>
<p>Profit-based feedback makes some roles in a business context slightly
more predictable and understandable. Even in that situation there are
trade-offs like long-term profit versus short-term profit and
externalization of costs.</p>
<p>The concept of bureaucracy is most visible for complex recurring
situations involving many people and the control of a shared resource.
The apparent friction of bureaucratic processes can be lower when there
are only a few people involved (“I’m just talking to my collaborator" or
“I’m just buying groceries from a clerk at the store” or “I’m using a
website for a government service”), but there is a continuous gradient
to more obvious instances of bureaucracy. Bureucratic tendencies are
observable at the small scale; they typically get ignored or called
something else.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy arises when management of a shared resource is necessary;
that resource can be external to the organization or internal to the
organization. Examples of external resources include mail delivery for
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service">USPS</a>,
public safety for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation">FBI</a>,
environment for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency">EPA</a>.
The focus of this book is on internal resources. Resources internal to a
bureaucratic organization include intangibles like attention, skill,
expertise. Metrics like time, money, and staffing are proxy measures for
the central intangible resources.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is a system for distributed knowledge and distributed
decision making. That is in contrast to easier-to-understand concepts
like centralized knowledge and centralized decision making. A government
run by dictatorship is easy to conceptualize compared to democracies
because there is a central character around which a narrative can be
formed. Similarly, stories about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> of
a company are much easier than capturing the thousands of interactions
conducted by the many employees of that company. The vast majority of
the work an organization does is coordinated and carried out by people
other than the CEO. Linear story-telling with a small number of
protagonists does not map well to the complexities of bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="bureaucrats-view-of-their-organization">Bureaucrat’s view of
their Organization<span id="sec:alternative_views_from_within"
label="sec:alternative_views_from_within"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy as I have defined it in §<a
href="#sec:define_bureaucracy" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:define_bureaucracy">[sec:define_bureaucracy]</a> is
not the only way that bureaucrats perceive their environment.
Bureaucrats typically focus on themselves, their work, their subjects,
their coworkers, their superiors, and their subordinates. The motives of
an individual bureaucrat for any given activity varies. The variance is
even more complicated when a request costs additional work and there’s
no deadline and there’s no reward. What is your incentive? Emotional
approval? Relationship building? Social approval?</p>
<p> <br />
The perspectives below are archetypal for bureaucrats who don’t consider
bureaucracy as defined in §<a href="#sec:define_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:define_bureaucracy">[sec:define_bureaucracy]</a>. In
practice an individual’s perspective might be a mixture of these
views.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is what I can accomplish with my
skills and the resources I have access to.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: This person is task oriented. Results are what
matters. The intricacies of bureaucracy are a distraction to getting the
work done. Communication for the purpose of coordination is a
distraction from work of the individual. This bureaucrat may have the
perception that if they initiate formation of a community, they will be
blamed when things go wrong. The emotional reward for this person is
accomplishment of the task. This person is likely to say to their
manager, “Tell me what I need to do to be successful" rather than
identify collaborations.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>As a bureaucrat, what matters is how I feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your feelings are real. They have consequence, in
that your emotions impact motivation and enthusiasm. However, a
feelings-centric perspective may not be productive for you or your team
or the organization. Being effective means compromise and some people
may not get everything they wanted. Balancing those competing needs is
challenging.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>What matters is how others feel.</strong><br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Depending on the emotional state of those around
you is unhealthy and can be unproductive. Working for the happiness or
satisfaction of other people is risky – they may not know what’s best,
or they may not have your interests in mind.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>What matters are my immediate coworkers.</strong><br />
This perspective can be positive (I collaborate with those around me) or
negative (I am in competition with those around me). In this scenario
everything beyond the local scope is personified or ignored.<br />
<em>Assessment</em>: Your do relationships matter. However, they are not
all that matters. Missing from this view is the ability to explain what
is happening outside the immediately observable realm.</p>
<p> <br />
Just because you are a bureaucrat doesn’t mean you have a well-informed
understanding of bureaucracy. Regardless of their perspective, a
bureaucrat certainly experiences the difficulties of operating within an
organization. A bureaucrat can rationalize to themselves why things
don’t work in their organization with stories like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>other people are lazy and don’t want to work.</p></li>
<li><p>other people are inexperienced.</p></li>
<li><p>other people don’t care.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There certainly are lazy people, inexperienced people, and people who
don’t care in any organization. Those are not unique to bureaucracy and
do not explain bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The bureaucrat who uses those stories applies them to people he or
she hasn’t directly interacted with. The person using these explanations
may not realize other people could use those same stories.</p>
<h2 id="models-of-bureaucracy">Models of Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:models-of-bureaucracy"

<p>Coming up with a holistic theory of bureaucracy is desirable but
difficult. Bureaucracy exists in every society, so having an explanatory
theory would help identify what is critical and what is not essential.
Having a theory of bureaucracy could help identify what should be
improved and what should be discarded. An expectation for the existence
of a theory stems from the repeated independent creation of bureaucracy
in diverse societies in different time periods.</p>
<p>Characterizing bureaucracy is difficult because organizations
comprised of unique humans are aware of attempts to be characterized and
respond to stories told about bureaucracy; see the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect">Hawthorne
effect</a>. As soon as a claim about bureaucracy-as-a-concept is made,
then a individual can respond to that claim by behaving in an opposing
manner. Worse still for the theory, bureaucrats can coordinate to
provide counterexamples.</p>
<p>In the following section I outline a few ways of modeling bureaucracy
for the purpose of pointing out the shortcomings of each model. The
relevance to the practicing bureaucrat of familiarity with these models
is so that you know the boundaries of each model. Awareness of the
limitations of each model enables you to know when the model is an
applicable story and when the model is not explanatory.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-as-a-machine">Bureaucracy as a Machine</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: Bureaucracy is a machine that has throughput and
latency and dependencies and mechanisms. Bureaucrats are cogs in that
machine.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Bureaucracy can be complicated and feel
mechanical with standardization, top-down dictates, and interlocking
processes. There is a risk of <a

<em>What this is missing</em>: Perceiving yourself as a cog in the wheel

<h3 id="bureaucracy-as-an-economic-model">Bureaucracy as an Economic
model</h3>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: A Bureaucracy is a Collection of Rational
actors.<br />
Individual bureaucrats cooperate or compete to promote their own
self-interests. The culture of an organization is a result of individual
self-interests of each bureaucrat. Individuals cheat, lie, or break
social norms to promote their own self-interests.</p>
<p>This view is hard for me to distinguish from a marketplace.</p>
<p><em>Narrative</em>: A Bureaucracy as a subcategory of a Firm.<br />
Firms exist in a market because negotiating contracts and prices for
every interaction is burdensome. A bureaucracy could be considered as a
type of firm that specializes at the organizational level in policy
administration or resource management.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-as-emergent-phenomenon">Bureaucracy as Emergent
phenomenon</h3>
<p>There is a universality to bureaucracy in both the diversity of
scenarios and persistence across time that hints at <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>.
Bureaucracy as a macroscopic phenomenon is emergent at when there are a
sufficient number of people. The size of the organization is important
because there is no longer dependence on individual relationships
(beyond <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>). There are people in the organization that you don’t know
and for which there is no personal accountability. An organization
subdivided into team recursively until there is local person-to-person
accountability. The underlying behaviors that enable emergence are
bilateral interactions among humans and a lack of feedback
mechanisms.</p>
<p>At the scale of individual bureaucrats, every person is playing by
different rules and has different objectives and everything is changing
– both the individuals and the conditions. Above the threshold for
emergence of bureaucracy there is scale-free behavior. The same patterns
are observable at large organizations and extremely large organizations.
A bureaucrat in one organization recognizes patterns of professional
life experienced by bureaucrats at another organization. The local
mechanisms bureaucrats employ to enable distributed decisions using
distributed knowledge include meetings, processes, and
communications.</p>
<p>The choices faced by an individual bureaucrat are not independent of
the choices made by other bureaucrats in their environment. There is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)">flocking
behavior</a> of my choices are informed by the choices of those around
me. Unlike flocking of birds, the adjacency metric for bureaucrats is
not necessarily spatial distance.</p>
<p>The relevance of claiming bureaucracy is emergent is that there is
behavior occurring at the macroscopic scale; knowing that individual
motives and actions of every player at the microscopic level is not
relevant.</p>
<p>A colloquial interpretation of emergent behavior from complex
phenomena is treating the system as an entity – personification. When an
organization is assigned behaviors (<span class="citation"
data-cites="2002_Gall">(Gall 2002)</span>), it is useful to remember
that the organization is comprised of bureaucrats.</p>
<p>More formally, there are distinct categories of emergence <span
class="citation" data-cites="2002_Bedau">(Bedau 2002)</span>. Nominal
emergence names the phenomena of a thing being distinct from its
constituents: a circle is emergent from a collection of points; a pile
of sand emerges from grains of sand. Merely putting many bureaucrats in
a room is insufficient to create bureaucracy; there are additional
aspects necessary to bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Weak emergence occurs when there are phenomena that are independent
of the underlying interactions. For example, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)">gliders</a>
in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s
Game of Life</a>. Weak emergence is measurable using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality">Granger
causality</a> or, equivalently<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_entropy">transfer
entropy</a> (information theory). I don’t know how to apply these
measures to bureaucratic organizations.</p>
<p><em>What this model is missing</em>: The problem with treating an
organization as an entity is that apparent behavior is
counter-intuitive. Breaking the organization into individual people with
motives helps clarify the cause of the behavior.</p>
<p>In practice, bureaucracy is worse than emergent because the rules can
be altered or ignored by the stakeholders. Bureaucracy is a <a

which resists mathematical models.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-in-game-theory">Bureaucracy in Game Theory</h3>
<p>Bureaucracy does not fit cleanly into the game theory categories of
being either cooperative or competitive – in practice there are elements
of both.</p>
<p>Maybe all the interactions within a bureaucracy are a bunch of small
games?</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is self-modifying.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is in constant flux due to external conditions,
externally imposed constraints, staff turn-over, internal dilemmas,
disagreements of individuals.</p>

<p> <br />
Each of the above models has shortcomings. Knowing why each model is not
a complete description helps you avoid the trap of thinking only in
terms of a single model.</p>
<p>The rest of this book ignores these partial characterizations of
bureaucracy. Rather than take the external (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emic_and_etic">emic</a>) view of
bureaucracy, this book takes the internal (etic) perspective of a
bureaucrat operating within an organization. The description of
bureaucracy in this book is to contextualize the advice for how to be an
effective bureaucrat.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-bureaucracy">Alternatives to bureaucracy <span
id="sec:alternatives_to_bureaucracy"
label="sec:alternatives_to_bureaucracy"></span></h2>
<p>A common refrain for participants in an organization is “Can’t we
just do the work?” In this section we’ll explore a few alternatives to
bureaucracy. These thought experiments illustrate the deficiencies of
each alternative.</p>
<h3 id="efficient-bureaucracy">Efficient Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>In an ideal scenario with no bureaucracy, everyone comes to the same
conclusion when presented with the same information regarding management
of shared resources. Efficient bureaucracy requires each person to know
the skills of everyone else so that anyone can act as an expert in any
field.</p>
<p>In this scenario the management process of building consensus becomes
unnecessary. There is no need to fight over resources (money, staffing)
and no need to fight over direction. A potential problem is that this
model of efficient bureaucracy based on everyone having the same view
may lack the diversity of views that enable robustness.</p>
<p>While that idealized scenario is not going to happen, it points to
how to improve bureaucratic efficiency. Each person has or should have
access to the same information. Each person should apply the same
decision making process consistently. Every person should have the same
incentives.</p>
<p>The reason bureaucracy is inefficient is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Not everyone has the same information</p></li>
<li><p>Processes are inconsistent</p></li>
<li><p>Incentives vary</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucrats and Subjects use imprecise language</p></li>
<li><p>Using opinions and experience rather than collect data and
analyze data</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritizing by putting out fires rather than attacking largest
issues</p></li>
<li><p>not responding to communications (email, phone,
meetings)</p></li>
<li><p>Being late to meetings</p></li>
<li><p>Scope creep</p></li>
<li><p>planned scope and capability scope (due to staffing or skills) is
mismatched</p></li>
<li><p>Silos of operation</p></li>
<li><p>Lies</p></li>
<li><p>Mistakes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, add the issue that each person’s reference experiences are
unique. As a consequence, decision making is subjective.</p>
<p>As an exercise for the reader, consider the following thought
experiment. What if everybody in a bureaucracy had a different opinion?
How would consensus be arrived at? Can an organization operate without
having to form consensus for every decision?</p>
<h3 id="perfect-bureaucracy">Perfect Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Starting with “perfect bureaucracy”, there are two perspectives: that
of the subject and that of the bureaucrat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the subject of a bureaucratic organization,
perfect bureaucracy means many things: minimizing the time the subject
waits on a decision, getting perfectly correct decisions, decisions are
consistent across subjects and circumstances, decisions take into
account all relevant factors, and there is zero cost to the subject. Any
process deviating from those expectations is a noticeable detriment to
the subject, leading to a negative reference experience of bureaucracy.
Never mind that the desires are unreasonable and conflicting. In a real
bureaucracy, subjects have a negative or neutral experience. Positive
interactions with bureaucracy are rare and are regarded as
anomalous.</p>
<p>Perfect bureaucracy for a bureaucrat means all information is
available, information is immediately available, and there is no moral
ambiguity (each answer is objective). Trade-offs become trivial and the
emotional toll of the work goes to zero. Then the bureaucrat is able to
serve subjects (an emotionally rewarding prospect). Note that this job
might be feel hollow if all decisions are obvious. In a real
bureaucracy, the typical experience is negative or neutral, punctuated
by glimpses of satisfaction.</p>
<h3
id="everyone-do-their-own-thing-no-coordination-no-bureaucracy">Everyone
do their own thing – No Coordination, No Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>The minimal scenario to start from is to imagine a single person
working on a single task that does not last long (a few minutes), is
relatively easy (cognitively and physically and emotionally), and does
not recur. In that situation, building consensus is irrelevant and no
process is required. Even then, it is often the case that this simple
task involves the use of shared limited resources – basic essentials
like water, air, land. If you task involves use of those things, then
how is equitable use determined among consumers?</p>
<p>Even for simplistic tasks, the concept of self-serve shared resources
for each person is not trivial. independent allocation of shared
resources breaks down and access is determined by violence.</p>
<p>Most of what you do occurs beyond the limits of simplicity and thus
incurs some concept of <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> (breaking a task into
subtasks). Staying with the one-person constraint, a complex task can
benefit from being broken into subtasks. Sometimes the order of the
subtasks matters, so we need to track the dependencies. A recurring
multi-step process with documentation is starting to have features of
bureaucracy, but lacks the need for consensus.</p>
<p>If one person lacks the skills relevant to a multi-step process, they
may engage another person to help. The interaction may be informal
(anarchy) or formalized in a contract (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">libertarian</a>). If
the parties working on the task fail to reach consensus, what is the
recourse? Options include physical violence, threats, or involving a
third party (e.g., a court with lawyers and judges).</p>
<p>To summarize, two aspects necessitate bureaucracy: shared resources
and shared responsibility. If you want to manage resources and
responsibilities, how is that policy decided? Building consensus is
relevant, but what is the process for establishing consensus? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism">Nepotism</a> and cultural
norms and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion">religious
practices</a> served this role prior to bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 id="limit-bureaucracy-to-a-single-decider">Limit Bureaucracy to a
Single Decider</h3>
<p>If we are going to live in a society and coordinate shared resources,
what if we had a single person deciding? How fast could that be? Good
decisions can’t be instantaneous – the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">OODA loop</a> is
necessary. “Observe" is the input, “act" is the output. These are
measurable; “orient" and “decide" are not as easy to measure. The
“orient" is the process of labeling data (received in the “observe"
phase) and connecting that information to what is already known.</p>
<p>Three minutes is not a lot of time to gather information and share it
to the relevant people, but let’s set that as a lower bound. If a single
decision takes three minutes, then in a ten hour work day that’s a max
of (10*60)/3 = 200 decisions per day. If this decider works 300 days out
of the year, that gets us to 60000 decisions per year. Everyone has to
talk to this decider directly since there’s no bureaucracy to gather or
disseminate the information. The diversity of questions regarding shared
resources would be challenging to answer well.</p>
<p>A bureaucracy of one person doesn’t scale. Within this constraint we
can’t just automate everything because carrying out the automation
requires a staff to implement. Automation isn’t free – it requires
creation and maintenance. Unless the same person making the decisions is
also the person creating and maintaining the system, there will be
multiple people in an organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy">Monarchies</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator">dictatorships</a> the
rely on a single decider. This is a simple model to understand, but
addressing all the edge cases for large society can be difficult. A
single decider doesn’t scale for the number of decisions needed, so the
decider then appoints bureaucrats to subjectively implement
policies.</p>
<p>If there’s more than one person in an organization, then
communication for coordination takes time. That’s the “orient” phase of
the OODA loop. Time spent orienting decreases the decision throughput of
the organization.</p>
<h3 id="just-use-common-sense">Just use Common Sense</h3>
<p><em>Claim</em>: Everything would go smoothly if each person used
common sense.</p>
<p>Common sense relies on reference experiences, cultural norms,
incentives, emotional state, psychological defects. These aspects are
particular to each person in an organization.</p>
<h3 id="completely-avoid-bureaucracy">Completely Avoid Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>That phrasing is more precisely worded by replacing “bureaucracy"
with “coordination of stakeholders". If you avoid coordination of
stakeholders, you either are constrained to only work on tasks that
involve one person, or you get is random (uncoordinated)
interactions.</p>
<h3 id="minimize-bureaucracy">Minimize Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Again, try replacing “bureaucracy" in with “coordination of
stakeholders". The goal of “minimizing coordination" probably isn’t the
real objective. To be more precise, a specific objective might be
“minimize time spent executing the task" (which takes a lot of
coordination prior to the task execution) or “minimize the level of
distraction to stakeholders" (chunk the coordination time). Another
strategy for minimizing bureaucracy is to reduce the number of
stakeholders involved. For a given task complexity, this means having
smarter people who have more skills. See Fig. <a
href="#fig:complexity-and-size" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:complexity-and-size">1.1</a> for a quantitative
trade-off.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Three levels of task complexity are
shown. As task complexity increases, the size of the team needs to grow.
The growth may be less if the team members are brilliant. Those
brilliant people cost more and there are fewer of them
available.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="automation-of-processes">Automation of Processes</h3>
<p>The role of automation is to make interactions more predictable,
faster, and to handle more of them. Automation does not eliminate
bureaucracy; automation obfuscates the subjective decisions and limits
the ability to negotiate with decision makers.</p>
<p>There are benefits to automation, and the automation can be
implemented to minimize harm to bureaucratic subjects. Automated systems
can be made more transparent by including documentation about what is
happening, why, and what’s next. This helps both bureaucrats and
subjects identify when assumptions made in the automation are
incorrect.</p>
<p>There are indicators of when to transition a human-based bureaucratic
process to a more automated approach <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The process to be automated is stable.</p></li>
<li><p>The expected lifespan for the process – how long the process will
be needed – is much longer than the time to implement the
automation.</p></li>
<li><p>The process logic relies on objective evaluation
criteria.</p></li>
<li><p>The process is frequent.</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of automating (both the initial creation cost as well as
the maintenance cost) represents a savings over the manual
implementation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="market-based-approach">Market-based Approach</h3>
<p>There is an alternative to bureaucracy that features decentralized
non-consensus approach to complexity: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)">markets</a>.</p>
<p>An over-simplified definition<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is “A market is a medium
that allows buyers and sellers of a specific good or service to interact
in order to facilitate an exchange." In practice, there is market
friction: “trading is always associated with certain costs or
restraints." <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The sources of friction in a market include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>commissions on trades</p></li>
<li><p>taxes (needed to fund contract enforcement
organizations)</p></li>
<li><p>uncertainty in hiring</p></li>
<li><p>constraints on firing labor</p></li>
<li><p>search cost in exploring the available opportunities</p></li>
<li><p>risk uncertainty</p></li>
<li><p>cost of creating contracts</p></li>
<li><p>cost of insurance</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Inefficiency of bureaucracies is inescapable because market friction
and bureaucratic inefficiency are equivalent. <a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Complex tasks at a societal scale range from manufacturing advanced
computer chips, to creating and distributing critical medicine, to
immigration and border enforcement. If an a society wants to accomplish
a complex task involving multiple people, then coordination of effort is
required. The coordination can be explicit (in the form of a
bureaucracy) or implicit (via a market). Bureaucracy is one response to
the complexity of a problem being solved.</p>
<p> <br />
Regardless of whether a bureaucratic or market-based approach is used,
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making are hindered by
aspects like limited bandwidth between people participating in the
coordination, non-zero latency of information between people, the cost
of getting data, and the cost of analysis of data. Due to these factors,
decisions that are suboptimal get made.</p>
<p> <br />
The objective and quantified concept of money creates accountability
that distinguishes commercial businesses from bureaucracy. Money is
common across all participants within the business and money is common
with external stakeholders. The goal of a company can be to generate
profit. Commercial businesses have people who make subjective decisions
and enforce policies, but there is a common metric for feedback. The
feedback mechanism is not perfectly applicable to all members of a
business. Being an effective commercial bureaucrat does not necessarily
result in monetary success.</p>
<p>Bureaucracies like prisons, schools, hospitals, governments, and
militaries all consume and spend money, but money isn’t the goal. When
faced with a decision, choice is not guided by which will generate more
profit. <span class="citation" data-cites="2012_Wilson">(C. M. Wilson
2012)</span></p>
<h3 id="adhocracy">Adhocracy</h3>
<p>Suppose I have a team of diverse experts assembled to tackle a
complex challenge. While this may be sufficient for short duration
tasks, if the challenge lasts more than a day or two there will be new
issues beyond the original challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>who pays the salary for this labor?</p></li>
<li><p>who calculates the payroll?</p></li>
<li><p>who pays the rent for facilities used by the team?</p></li>
<li><p>who does the maintenance on the</p></li>
<li><p>facilities and equipment used?</p></li>
<li><p>who cleans the facility?</p></li>
<li><p>does risk incurred mean insurance is needed?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To address these questions that are out-of-scope for the complex
challenge, you can either use a market-based approach or build a
bureaucracy.</p>
<h3 id="elected-representatives">Elected representatives</h3>
<p>Political representatives are an easier to understand concept because
it’s just one person acting in that behalf of other people. In contrast,
the emergent behavior of bureaucracy is more difficult to
understand.</p>
<p>TODO: why not make the entire system out of politicians?</p>
<p> <br />
If you think bureaucracy sucks and it should be removed or replaced,
then the parable of Chesterton’s fence applies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There exists ... a fence or gate erected across a road. The more
modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the
use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type
of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I
certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you
can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you
to destroy it.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to understand the historical progression of each process
that your organization relies on so that you understand the reason
bureaucracy exists.</p>
<h3 id="imagine-your-own-organization">Imagine your own
Organization</h3>
<p>Suppose that you are part of an organization that doesn’t have
oversight processes for finances and the resources your organization is
responsible for. A small percentage of the population, say 0.1%, will
take advantage of the lack oversight for their own gain. Those malicious
actors can be either subjects of bureaucracy or bureaucrats within the
organization. Bruce Schneier calls these people defectors <span
class="citation" data-cites="2012_Schneier">(Schneier 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, suppose a small percentage of the population, say 0.1%, is
stupid and makes intentional mistakes. Without a review process, these
mistakes will negative impact your organization’s finances and the
resources your organization manages. Preventing, detecting, and
correcting mistakes can be costly investments.</p>
<h2 id="scope-of-bureaucracy">Scope of bureaucracy</h2>
<h3 id="who-is-a-bureaucrat">Who is a bureaucrat?</h3>
<p>A cashier in a gas station is a bureaucrat. The “policy” might simply
be “take money from customer in exchange for items and gas,” but the
subjective application of that policy leaves a lot of room for the
cashier to shape the customer’s experience. Does the cashier greet the
customer when the customer enters the store? Does the cashier look at
the customer to acknowledge the customer? Smile? How quickly does the
cashier engage the customer? Minor nuances that are left to the cashier
in the execution of the store policy means there is room for subjective
application of the policy.</p>
<p>A bank teller, a loan officer, and a bank IT support are all
bureaucrats. They subjectively enforce policies on behalf of the
organization. And the feedback of financial impact has varying
clarity.</p>
<p>This same discretionary application of policy applies to commercial
bureaucrats like sandwich makers, car salespeople, oil well drillers,
grocery clerks, retail clerks, bankers, and plumbers. Public school
teachers, state and federal police, military members, tax collectors,
and other state workers are government bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Factory line workers subjectively apply policies. Enforcement of
quality standards is the most obvious area. Pacing of work is a
negotiation.</p>
<p>Structured environments like sports featuring well defined rules do
not eliminate bureaucracy. Teammates use subjective policies on who to
work with and how to best leverage their strengths and exploit the
opponent’s weaknesses. Referees make subjective determinations about
rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes bureaucrats do not work directly with customers or citizens
or products. Then the bureaucratic process is inflicted on fellow
bureaucrats. In this scenario, a bureaucrat is subjectively applying a
policy to other bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Identifying yourself as a bureaucrat matters, both to the employee
and to the business. The risk of not self-identifying as a bureaucrat is
that you won’t grasp how much control you have in implementing and
enforcing policy. If you think of yourself as having to blindly follow
rules, you will harm the people you are applying the rules to and you
will harm the business/institution you are applying the rules for.
Adapting policies to circumstances is the value of having judgement
capacity.</p>
<p>In a similar sense from the consumer/citizen perspective, if you
don’t think you are interacting with a bureaucracy, you won’t perceive
the opportunity to negotiate. If you view rules as fixed and inflexible,
you will harm your ability to make progress. If a rule was made by a
human, then that rule is flexible. Who made the rule? Who enforces the
rule? If you can talk to them, could they be convinced to make a
modification or an exception?</p>
<p>If you don’t think about a bureaucratic framing, you might think the
store clerk enforcing a policy is because they don’t like you, and you
might not recognize that talking with a manager could be more
productive.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as a bureaucrat, you’ll behave
differently in your job. The paradigm of “just tell me what to do” is
the default (learned in school) and you won’t know how to engage with
coworkers/bosses since they are not friends. You will be less likely to
understand how to leverage the organization; identify collective wisdom.
Thinking from the perspective of a bureaucrat explains why evangelizing
within org is relevant. You’ll see your coworkers as competitors for
promotion.</p>
<p>if you think of yourself as merely a cog in a machine, you are less
likely notice that you exert influence in the process and you are less
likely to recognize the autonomy available to you. if you think "I have
a real job [e.g., nurse, cashier, teacher], so therefore I’m not a
bureaucrat", you are less likely to recognize the subjective power you
have in interactions with the public if you think, "I’m at the bottom of
my organization’s hierarchy, therefore I do not have power", you are
less likely to notice the autonomy when it is available.</p>
<p>If you don’t think of yourself as part of a bureaucratic process,
you’ll behave differently in interactions with bureaucrats. You won’t
perceive opportunities to negotiate because the processes seem fixed
instead of subjective. You won’t recognize motives and incentives of
bureaucrats, so their activities will seem incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-people-in-a-bureaucracy">Number of people in a
bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Although bureaucracy can be present for one person, and bureaucracy
is often apparent on teams (e.g., 3 to 20 people), this book primarily
focuses on the situation of multiple teams comprising an organization.
This might be a few hundred people (above <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar&#39;s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>) up to millions of people. Examples of companies that employ
more than a million people<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> include Walmart, Amazon,
and McDonald’s. Size isn’t a requirement for bureaucracy. Small
companies with a few people incur bureaucracy. Non-profit organizations
encounter bureaucracy. Bureaucracy emerges in small organizations, has
patterns that are scale invariant, and is generic across sectors. The
complexity of the tasks may be different, but the same scale-independent
patterns can emerge because of a common factor: human behavior.</p>
<p>Size of bureaucracy scales with the complexity of the problem. For
example, if participants in a society only used hand tools they could
make themselves, then there is little need for bureaucracy. Mining and
producing small amounts of metal is feasible for an individual, though
the relevance of specialization becomes clearer. A society large enough
to support the technology of writing (beyond the use of clay tablets)
seems to coincide with the bureaucratic need for writing. Getting to
technology like the telegraph and radio requires a society that supports
complex processes and specialization – key aspects of bureaucratic
systems. While decreasing bureaucracy is certainly feasible, it’s not
clear how to maintain the current technological sophistication.</p>
<p>In addition to essential task complexity, the size of bureaucracy
depends on accidental factors like how old the bureaucracy is, how big
the community being supported is, and how diverse the community is.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-of-bureaucracy">Fundamentals of Bureaucracy<span
id="fundamentals_of_b" label="fundamentals_of_b"></span></h2>
<p>Bureaucracy as a system of distributed knowledge and distributed
decision making. The intent is to manage shared resources. The decision
making is not purely logical; it relies on particular facets of human
interaction. This section outlines the critical roles of decision
making, hierarchy, and communication in bureaucracy. My list is smaller
than Max Weber’s <span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Weber">(Weber
2015)</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Decision making (§<a href="#sec:decision-making"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:decision-making">[sec:decision-making]</a>) is
central to bureaucracy. Every other aspect of bureaucracy derives from
decision making. The decision making is with respect to the subjective
management of resources.</p>
<p>When there are multiple people present, or even when one person is
trying to be self-consistent, coordination of decision making is
important to the management of resources. While coordination can occur
without hierarchy when there are a small number of people, typically an
organization of people leads to both formal and informal hierarchies.
Who gets to make which decision is managed using hierarchy; see §<a
href="#sec:hierarchy_of_roles" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:hierarchy_of_roles">[sec:hierarchy_of_roles]</a>.</p>
<p>Meetings and written communication help with consensus among
bureaucrats, though agreement isn’t necessarily the outcome. Once a
decision is made, the choice selected by a person propagates throughout
the organization to achieve some level of consistency. See §<a
href="#sec:meetings-for-coordination" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:meetings-for-coordination">[sec:meetings-for-coordination]</a>
on meetings and §<a href="#sec:written-communication"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:written-communication">[sec:written-communication]</a>
on written communication.</p>
<p>If you’re not an academic researcher of bureaucracy, you might be
thinking that you don’t want to have to think about hierarchy or
collaboration or coordination. Meetings and email are not your goal; you
just want to do the tasks that you were trained for. Your formal
education process had individual grading. You perceive your job as a
bureaucrat as having pay, promotion, hiring/firing, and title that seem
focused on your individual abilities. The following sections explain why
the individualist mentality is ineffective when you are part of a system
of distributed knowledge and distributed decision making.</p>
<h3 id="decision-making-in-a-bureaucracy">Decision making in a
bureaucracy<span id="sec:decision-making"
label="sec:decision-making"></span></h3>
<p>Decision are not the only source of change in an organization.
Occasionally events unfold without decisions being made. This might be
because the decision makers are not informed, or there is an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willful_blindness">intentional
neglect</a>. This section focuses on situations where bureaucrats
recognize the need for a decision and want to make the best
decision.</p>
<p>There are multiple types of decisions. A <span
data-acronym-label="simple decision"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">simple decision</span> has one
correct or beneficial choice and one or more wrong or harmful choices.
The work of decision making is then to gather information that
identifies which is the correct or beneficial choice and select that
option.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for any decision making is one person making a
well-informed simple decision that has immediate consequence and the
consequence is to the decision maker. Examples from elementary formal
education include arithmetic math problems, multiple choice quizzes,
spelling tests, and memorization tests. A bureaucrat’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_injury">moral injury</a> can
come from decision making that involves multiple people, weak feedback
loops, and complex decisions.</p>
<h4 id="example-decision-method-pareto-frontier">Example Decision
Method: Pareto Frontier<span id="sec:pareto"
label="sec:pareto"></span></h4>
<p>A complex decision may have many choices, and there are might not be
a best option. Then a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front">Pareto frontier</a>
might exist where trade-offs can be made.</p>
<p>As an example of a complex decision made by one person with immediate
consequence and direct relevance to the decision maker, suppose you want
to purchase a car. You car about only two aspects: fuel efficiency and
cost.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="images/pareto_frontier_car_options.pdf"
id="fig:pareto_frontier_cars" style="width:100.0%" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Four cars, L, M, N, and P. The goal of
the buyer is to spend less money and get better fuel efficiency. Choices
not on the frontier should be avoided, but that doesn’t yield a single
result.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Visualzing a Pareto frontier for two quantitative variables is easy,
but typically decisions involve more factors. For example, evaluating
the trade-off of three quantitative variables like speed, accuracy, and
cost creates a surface. With more than three variables visualization are
less useful, though the analysis technique still applies.</p>
<p>Another constraint on using Pareto frontier analysis is that it works
well when there are many options relative to the number of variables
being optimized for. The assessment does not work as well when there are
few choices relative to the number of variables. For example, suppose
there are 10 choices of car and you want high fuel efficiency,
sufficient cargo capacity, maximum number of passengers, stylish, low
cost, low maintenance, good durability, and high resale value.</p>
<p>For a set of quantitative variables, a Pareto frontier does not
account for relative importance of different variables. Assign weights
to each of these factors merely stretches one axis relative to the other
axes.</p>
<p>There are many possible decision making frameworks besides Pareto
frontiers, but in practice a typical bureaucratic decision is
ill-informed, has diffuse consequences, delayed impact, and does not
affect the decision maker. In bureaucratic processes there is rarely a
formal assessment of options. Decisions are rarely recorded. Even
afterwards a decision can be difficult to evaluate for correctness
because there are multiple stakeholders.</p>
<h4 id="risks-of-using-decision-frameworks">Risks of Using Decision
Frameworks</h4>
<p>Decision making frameworks can be attractive to bureaucrats intending
to formalize processes (see §<a href="#sec:process"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:process">[sec:process]</a>) and encourage
predictability. There are potential risks worth being aware of.</p>
<p>A decision is political when the basis is historical relationships,
maintenance or creation of a relationship, or to enable future
relationships. A decision is subjective when someone else faced with the
same scenario would have come to a different conclusion. A decision is
quantitative when it is based on measurements. To avoid the appearance
of subjective decision making or political decision making, a decision
may be framed as “data driven." A good approach for data driven
quantitative analysis involves coming up with a testable hypothesis,
then performing experiments and collecting data to evaluate the
hypothesis. More commonly, a decision is made, then data is gathered
which supports the desired outcome. Forming an opinion and then looking
for evidence to back the outcome yields suboptimal results for the
organization.</p>
<p>Even if a bureaucrat is not intentionally biased towards an outcome,
there are many ways to gather evidence and some approaches have biased
sampling and produce biased results.</p>
<p>With valid and representative data measurement, decision makers can
be led astray by poor modeling. A model may use inapplicable techniques,
or may have implementation bugs.</p>
<p>For all the dangers of decision making methods, there are worse
approaches that do not rely on measurement. People rely on history (if
they are aware of it) and perpetuate bad ideas, or take action based on
what is best for their career, or decide based on how to accumulate more
power, or simply choose based on what someone else says to do.</p>
<h4 id="decision-making-delay">Decision Making Delay<span
id="sec:decision-delay" label="sec:decision-delay"></span></h4>
<p>What appears from the outside as “organizational inertia” is internal
delay of decision making and the delay of dissemination. Delay comes
from</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It takes time for each decision maker to gather information,
arrive at a decision, modify processes, disseminate their selection,
justify their selection.</p></li>
<li><p>forcing a continuous variable into a discrete set of choices.
Typically the number of choices is small. Discrete choices for a
continuous variable is a loss of effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p>processes designed to account for cheaters and people with
malicious intent, whether that means a malicious bureaucrat or malicious
subject.</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis paralysis, due to <span>insufficient information, too
much information, which framing is unclear</span></p></li>
<li><p>When other people who are needed to carry out the action push
back, either in disagreement or seeking clarification. The fact that the
organization is not profit driven is important because the justification
for the action isn’t quantitatively obvious. Therefore there’s a higher
burden for communication.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-bureaucratic-decision-involves-many-decisions">A Bureaucratic
Decision involves many Decisions</h4>
<p>A decision is actually a collection of dependent choices. After
recognizing the need for a decision, follow-on decisions include
identifying the stakeholders (who to include in an impact analysis) and
identifying options. Who is a stakeholder and what are the options are
interrelated. Involving more people expands the number of options and
the complexity. Additional choices associated with reducing uncertainty
are how much time to spend on the decision, how much information to
gather for the decision, whether the make the decision or push the
decision to someone with more expertise, whether to push the decision to
someone with more exposure to the consequences.</p>
<p>Most decisions you make as a bureaucrat do not have hard deadlines.
Instead, there are trade-offs in allocation of your time. Sooner is
preferable since the consequence of the decision benefits the
organization and allows you to focus on other tasks, but delaying allows
for more information gathering for a better informed decision. (See
Dilemma <a href="#table:gather_data_lots-vs-little"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="table:gather_data_lots-vs-little">3.17</a> and other
related Dilemmas in that section.)</p>
<p>If a bureaucrat is going to rely on expert consultation (see §<a
href="#sec:expertise" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:expertise">[sec:expertise]</a> on expertise), the
decision maker needs to be confident the expert is not of straying
outside their area of expertise. For example, I don’t rely on a botanist
with many published papers to tell me how to change the oil in my car.
Besides knowing their own limitations, the expert should be clear about
whether their input is a factual summary, a predictive assessment, or a
value judgement. This nuance complicates what you as a bureaucrat are
interested in (what’s the best choice?).</p>
<h4 id="transparency-of-decision-making">Transparency of Decision
Making<span id="sec:transparency-of-decisions"
label="sec:transparency-of-decisions"></span></h4>
<p>Your decision making process might change if made visible to
stakeholders. You may provide clearer justifications, or spend more time
gathering evidence to support a claim. Strengthening the arguments is
beneficial but takes time and resources.</p>
<p>Frank conversations and exploratory brainstorming need protections to
allow participants to be vulnerable. This is the motive for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House
Rule</a>. At the same time, people impacted by the decisions benefit
from understanding how the decisions were made – see examples like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_in_the_Sunshine_Act">Sunshine
laws</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)">FoIA</a>.
Even the symbolism of survelince changes behavior <a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Making decisions transparently can make participants more risk averse
because of the potential for failure.</p>
<p>The concept of transparency can apply before a decision is issued,
while a policy is in effect, or after the consequence (as part of a
review).</p>
<h3 id="hierarchy-of-roles">Hierarchy of Roles<span
id="sec:hierarchy_of_roles" label="sec:hierarchy_of_roles"></span></h3>
<p>Ideally sufficient depth and breath for decision making would be
embodied in one person. That might not be possible in every situation.
One way to resolve this is to identify distinct scopes of responsibility
and then assign different members of an organization separate scopes for
decision making. Within a decision making scope there may be more work
than one person can handle, so a team is formed. That team may have some
members focused on tactical work and other members focused on strategy
and coordination. Hierarchy within an organization is the formalization
of separate decision-making scopes and associated specialization.</p>
<p>Partitioning knowledge and decision making enables complexity beyond
what one person can accomplish and causes friction among members. An
expert reporting to a manager knows things the manager does not, and the
manager may have context that the expert lacks. Both bureaucrats (the
expert and the manager) need to convey their respective nuance and seek
out the holistic view.</p>
<p>A hierarchical organization with partitioned knowledge introduces a
challenge: the order in which you share information with others matters.
Your choices for who to first describe an idea to are your peers, your
management, and your subordinates. The people subordinate to you know
more about the topic and are exposed to the consequences. Giving them a
chance to vet the idea results in a more robust idea and validates their
value in organization. Sharing your idea with management first allows
your superiors to provide context you might not be aware off. Starting
the conversation with your peers first indicates you value the
relationship and decrease the risk of overlapping work.</p>
<p> <br />
Although I’ve included hierarchy in the section on Fundamentals of
Bureaucracy, I don’t mean to imply that hierarchy is a required feature
of bureaucracy. Hierarchies of bureaucrats are a common <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure">organizational
structure</a> and therefore worthy studying even if not essential to
bureaucracy. The relevance of understanding hierarchy is to identify
recurring behavior and patterns to leverage. Organizations of
bureaucrats can intentionally work against hierarchy, but the amount of
effort needed to enable alternatives implies that hierarchy is a natural
approach.</p>
<p>The benefits of formal hierarchy include improved capacity for the
number of policy decision made, enabling consistency of decisions, and
leveraging specialization of knowledge. Hierarchical decision making has
costs: higher latency, inconsistency among bureaucrats, waste due to
inefficiency, and many others described in §<a
href="#sec:unavoidable_hazards" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:unavoidable_hazards">[sec:unavoidable_hazards]</a>.
As another example of harm, hierarchy enables strategic ignorance.
Bureaucrats in positions of power can deny having knowledge of improper
activity. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>The structure of an organization is dynamic, but at each point in
time an organization typically has a defined set of roles. Each role is
distinguished by different scopes of decision authority.</p>
<p>Roles in an organization are defined by the boundaries of
responsibility. The purpose of a role is to minimize conflict and reduce
redundancy, allowing control. Clear responsibility enables effective
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>A conventional characterization of an organization’s hierarchy
involves two criteria: the depth and breadth of the org chart. The more
people a supervisor oversees, the flatter the organization – that’s the
breadth of the organization. See the Valve handbook <span
class="citation" data-cites="2012_Valve">(unknown 2012)</span> and
Joreen’s essay <span class="citation" data-cites="1972_Joreen">(Joreen
1972)</span> for contrasting views on the shape of an organization’s
hierarchy. Depth of the hierarchy is how many layers there are.</p>
<p>A more practical view of an organization’s hierarchy also involves
two criteria. The two choices in how a hierarchy is shaped are 1) how
many people a supervisor oversees and 2) how many supervisors a person
has. Though you might naively expect that an employee has one boss, but
that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management">not a
requirement</a>. A supervisor for a given topic may have many people
reporting to them, and a bureaucrat with multiple roles may report to
more than one supervisor.</p>
<p> <br />
Acting as part of a group means ceding part of your autonomy. Hierarchy
is an additional layer of ceding responsibility and adding expectations
about relationships. The consequence of hierarchy in an organization
means that as a member of the bureaucracy you do not have full autonomy
– otherwise you would not be a member of the hierarchy. At the same time
you are not under strict control of the organization – you still have
some subjective decision making authority as a bureaucrat.</p>
<p>The person at the top of the hierarchy does not know everything. The
person at the top of the hierarchy does not have input on every decision
made in the organization. Some autonomy is retained by all members of
the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Independent of the defined roles and designated titles in an
organization’s hierarchy, there are a set of implicit roles and a
separate social hierarchy of informal influencers and decision makers.
Informal influencers in a bureaucracy usually have long relationships
with the decision maker or relevant credentials or both. The credentials
can be formal (e.g., a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy">PhD</a>) or
informal (demonstrated success on a project). In either case, the
decision maker is relying on another person’s expertise.</p>
<p>Another set of informal relations within an organization is mentors
and mentees. These relations allow mentors to transmit institutional
knowledge to mentees, and allows people in senior positions to access
the novice perspective.</p>
<p> <br />
One consequence of hierarchy is a sense of fear felt by people who
report to other people. This fear stems from the loss of control (less
autonomy) that leaves the person feeling disempowered.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following relationship. A person, Sue, is
perceived to have power over another person, Amy, because Amy gave up
some control to Sue. Amy not having control triggers the feeling of fear
in Amy, regardless of how Sue behaves.</p>
<p>If Sue is aware of the potential for this emotional experience, Sue
can compensate for Amy’s fear by being friendly and receptive towards
Amy. Alternatively Sue may exploit or rely on the fear felt by
subordinates.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="organizational-chart-as-a-guide-and-a-lie">Organizational chart as a
guide and a lie</h4>
<p>An <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart">organizational
chart</a> (hereafter “org chart”) identifies formal roles and the formal
relations among roles. An org chart is at best a snapshot in time, and
more often aspirational than descriptive. In spite of possible
deficiencies, an org chart helps outsiders and newcomers understand the
scope of responsibilities and interactions.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Org charts are a lie in the sense that undocumented relationships can
matter more than the official roles. Org charts fail to capture the
informal roles and network of relations that facilitate progress in any
organization.</p>
<p>Org charts foster a second separate lie by creating sense power
dynamics based on visual orientation. For more on this issue see § <a

necessary artifact for facilitating coordination. The coordination
accomplished by a meeting can be explicit (verbal or written), or it can

provided).</p>

<p>The feedback mechanisms for a bureaucrat are reputation and
retroactive accountability in the form of what did you know and when did
you know it Reputation is social Retroactive accountability depends on
written records from meeting notes emails agendas reports</p>
<p>Because of the lack of quantitative feedback loops, there is
significant interest in justification, proactive monitoring, reporting,
and retroactive assessment. That creates more bureaucracy</p>
<p>When there is a lack of feedback from customers/users, then someone
has to decide.</p>
<p>when there are multiple competing objectives among different
stakeholders in a zero sum use of resources, how to determine what’s
best? Typically there are feedback loops to guide progress. When
feedback loops are weak or not present, then the most powerful
stakeholder (which is distinct from the biggest or loudest) will
dominate.</p>

<h4 id="tsa-agent-making-a-fair-decision">TSA agent making a fair
decision</h4>
<p>I was going through passport control. There was a TSA officer
directing people into one of two lines. Both lines were long. The lines
were not of equal length. Both lines terminate at a bunch of passport
checking agents. Each passport check takes a minute. Passport checking
TSA officers operate independently and concurrently.</p>
<p>The TSA officer’s perspective is that there are two long lines. His
procedure is two balance the two lines (for fairness). He does this by
pointing people into one of the two lines, with his choice driven which
line has room available.</p>
<p>Two people enter and are directed by the TSA officer. The first
person is directed left, the second goes right. The TSA officer’s job is
completed.</p>
<p>The person in the left line finishes 5 minutes before the person in
the line on the right. This difference in completion time is frustrating
is frustrating for the person who is in the line on the right.</p>
<p>Because the lines are not of equal length, balancing the start of the
line is an suboptimal method. The consequence is that what seems fair to
the TSA officer ends up not being fair for people going through the
line. The TSA officer had incomplete information – the lines are not of
equal length. Because the TSA officer isn’t exposed to the consequence
of is approach, he doesn’t get feedback on whether it is suboptimal or
not.</p>
<p>Lesson: if the people making decisions do not experience the
consequences of those decisions, then they are not incentivized to
improve decision making.</p>
<p>The person in the longer line feels frustrated. The negative feeling
is due to a sense of powerlessness, and that the situation is recurring,
and a better solution is available.</p>
<p>The optimal solution in this situation is to have a single line
feeding the multiple TSA passport checkers. This eliminates the need for
the decision maker.</p>
<h4 id="parking-garage">Parking garage</h4>
<p>Bob parks his car in a parking garage every day. The parking garage
owner charges $20 per day for people to park their car.</p>
<p>Bob recently found that one of the exit gates for the parking garage
is broken. If Bob uses that gate to leave the parking garage, the gate
does not function and Bob cannot exit. Then Bob has to call the parking
gate operator to request an exception (which is granted) and Bob can
then exit that gate, avoiding the $20/day charge.</p>
<p>This action (go to broken gate, request exception, avoid charge) has
been repeated for a long time (months). Bob’s motive is to avoid the $20
parking charge; the cost is a mere phone call and a minor delay. This
cheating behavior harms the parking garage owner’s income. However, the
parking gate operator, serving as intermediary, insulates the parking
garage owner from the interaction with the cheater. The cheating
behavior is small enough that the parking garage owner may not
notice.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-bureaucracy">History of Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>After making two points in this area, I’m going to skip the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy#History">history of
bureaucracy</a>.</p>
<p>First, bureaucracy has repeatedly arisen independently in a variety
of cultures lasting for timescales that exceed the lifespan of one
person<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>. That indicates the current
situation is not a fluke or coincidence. There is some utility (or
pathology) that is consistently recurring.</p>
<p>Second, bureaucracy predates writing and language and even humans!
Subjective policy enforcement in support of an organization arises in
pre-human tribes, visible in groups of modern apes.</p>
<h1 id="bureaucracy-in-general">Bureaucracy in general<span

<h2 id="each-phase-of-life-involves-bureaucracy">Each Phase of Life
involves Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>In each person’s life there are standard milestones: birth,
education, work, death. The relationships in each phase are distinct.
Each of these milestones and phases involves bureaucracy. Each phase is
a different experience of bureaucracy because the bureaucratic roles
change.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-of-birth">Bureaucracy of Birth<span
id="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"
label="sec:bureacracy-of-birth"></span></h3>
<p>Your birth was marked by getting a name, registering with the state,
and initiating medical records. These tasks were administered by
bureaucrats on your behalf. The bureaucrats included the hospital staff,
and you were the subject of the bureaucracy. You had no autonomy or
decision making authority.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy-in-early-childhood">Bureaucracy in early
childhood<span id="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"
label="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"></span></h3>
<p>Prior to starting education, the bureaucracy of early childhood is
inflicted primarily by family members setting and carrying out policies.
The organization of bureaucrats is the family. Other community members
or caretakers may also be involved to carry out the polices of taking
care of you. Your decision making authority was extremely limited.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucrats-at-school">Bureaucrats at School<span
id="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"
label="sec:bureaucracy-of-school"></span></h3>
<p>Once you started the education process, new bureaucrats got involved.
The community of bureaucrats could be a public school, a private school,
or homeschooling. In any of those cases, the frontline bureaucrat is the
teacher. You don’t have responsibility for making policy that other
people follow; you are still the subject of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The expectations of each phase of school (high school, undergraduate,
graduate school) are distinct, and they are different from working in a
large organization. Your autonomy increases throughout the duration of
school. Your family and teachers are the bureaucrats. You start building
informal organizations of friends, and you start to explore policies
around social bonding.</p>
<p>Schooling sets a pattern that most students will fall into for the
rest of their lives. You were handed a textbook and told to solve a set
of problems. You have the autonomy to do more than what is required. You
can find other textbooks that match your interests or are written from a
different view.</p>
<p>You get to choose the book you want, even if you don’t get to choose
the topic you are going to be evaluated on. You don’t even need to pick
just one reference book – you can pick lots of books and figure out
which author style best fits you. You can also choose the level of
difficulty – very basic and beginner level, or more advanced (depending
on where you are, rather than where a class in school is supposed to
be).</p>
<p>You can discover how you learn best. This extra effort requires
self-reflection: How did you learn? What worked best? What didn’t work,
and why not? What did you learn? What do you wish you had learned?</p>
<p>Another pattern that schooling relies on is single choice decisions
where there is only one right answer. Examples include math problems and
multiple choice tests. Schooling tends to avoid setting up dilemmas or
paradoxes for students. Academic problems in the education process are
designed to be independent of the people involved or the history of the
situation.</p>
<p>In my schooling I learned how to approach technical issues and
develop solutions. That problem-solution paradigm neglects crucial steps
of discovering the problem, isolating the challenge, identifying
stakeholders, learning the history of the challenge, and negotiating
with stakeholders before attempting to address the challenge.</p>
<p>My schooling led me to emphasize academics over socializing. When I
transitioned to professional work, I realized that social skills and
political savvy useful when attempting to change organizations and
policies.</p>
<p>Unlike academic problems that rely on and evaluate my answers,
working in a bureaucratic organization the challenges are ill-defined,
there’s no known solution, and the problem is sufficiently complex that
I have to collaborate.</p>
<h3 id="military-service-bureaucracy">Military Service Bureaucracy<span
id="bureaucracy-of-military"
label="bureaucracy-of-military"></span></h3>
<p>Less than 0.5% of the United States population serves in the
military<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>. For those who do serve, the
military’s rigid hierarchy and defined protocols is a distinct
experience compared to school or work. The transition from military to
civilian life can present a dissonance for service members used to the
chain of command and clearly defined orders.</p>
<h3 id="working-in-a-bureaucratic-organization">Working in a
bureaucratic organization<span id="sec:bureaucracy-of-work"
label="sec:bureaucracy-of-work"></span></h3>
<p>Within the employment phase, there are pairs start and end events
which may apply: hiring or getting hired; firing, getting fired, or
quitting.</p>
<p>employment: managers above you, peer employees, people you manage are
all members of an organization.</p>
<p>You encounter shared resources at work: bathrooms, conference rooms,
kitchen areas with fridges and microwaves, storage areas.</p>
<p>Bathroom example: the bathroom smells sometimes so I’m a nice person
and I bring a scented air freshener. Unbeknownst to me, that triggers an
asthma or allergic reaction for my coworkers. Now a policy gets created
so this mistake doesn’t happen again. Signs are posted.</p>
<h3 id="healthcare-and-death">Healthcare and Death<span
id="sec:bureaucracy-of-death"
label="sec:bureaucracy-of-death"></span></h3>
<p>Doctors and nurses are bureaucrats; you are the subject; the hospital
or clinic is the organization.</p>
<p>Toilet paper at the hospital If you go to a hospital, use the
bathroom, and find there is no toilet paper, that would indicate a
deficiency. Someone didn’t refill the toilet paper. Since the person who
normally refills toilet paper wasn’t also a user, they aren’t directly
impacted by the lack of toilet paper. So someone needs to have a routine
of checking bathrooms for toilet paper availability. Money spent
checking to toilet paper is money not spent on the primary mission of
the hospital. Minimizing checking is important, so a feedback mechanism
is instituted – a phone number to text regarding bathroom status at the
hospital.</p>
<p>Death can invoke both the medical system and the government.</p>
<p> <br />
All of these roles and relationship involve subjectively administered
policies within an organization. The point of recognizing the role of
bureaucrats is to help you identify what is negotiable.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-bureaucracy-is-nearly-impossible">Avoiding Bureaucracy
is Nearly Impossible</h2>
<p>The only situation where bureaucracy might not exist is if you live
completely on your own, with no interaction with other people. That
means completely disengaging from society. Even then, personal routines
are a self-imposed form of bureaucracy, with the roles of policy maker,
bureaucrat, and subject collapsed to a single person – you.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency and autonomy are attractive alternatives
bureaucracy. The way participants in modern society strive for
self-sufficiency is by denying their dependence on modern society.
That’s a relabeling of selfishness which feels better.</p>
<p>For the rest of us who operate as members of a society, bureaucracy
is necessary for our rights. We prove our name by cooperating with other
people, and our name helps us claim our citizenship. That’s a subjective
policy that <span data-acronym-label="stakeholder"
data-acronym-form="plural+short">stakeholders</span> in society agree
to.</p>
<p>The specific way a society is constructed (democratic, authoritarian,
dictatorship, anarchy) is irrelevant – bureaucracy is still present.
Even the libertarian view of relying on contract enforcement implies
some amount of bureaucracy (e.g., forums for resolving contract disputes
like a court system).</p>
<p>Not all bureaucracy is due to the state, nor is bureaucracy confined
to companies. Parenting involves coming up with situation-specific
requirements for children, with the organization being the family as
mentioned in §<a href="#sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood">[sec:bureaucracy-early-childhood]</a>.
Dress codes for sports teams are arbitrary standards. Store clerks are
bureaucrats, as are website forum moderators. Content moderation is the
process of (inconsistently) enforcing arbitrary standards. This mindset
even permeates individuals as internalized expectations of policy and
enforcement when no one else is present.</p>
<p>Recognizing instances of bureaucracy enables more skillful
interaction, whether as a bureaucrat or as a subject. The remainder of
this section illustrates both the view of a person interacting with
bureaucracy as a <span data-acronym-label="subject"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">subject</span>, and the perspective
of bureaucrats working within organizations.</p>
<h2 id="not-many-options-for-organizations">Not many options for
organizations</h2>
<p>Organizations comprised of bureaucrats have fewer options than
individual bureaucrats. The choices an individual bureaucrat faces are
described in the section on dilemmas, §<a href="#sec:dilemma_trilemma"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:dilemma_trilemma">[sec:dilemma_trilemma]</a>. In
comparison, the choices faced in the design of an organization are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>flatness of organizational hierarchy</p></li>
<li><p>number of supervisors per employee</p></li>
<li><p>teams: create a new team, merge existing teams, dissolve a
team</p></li>
<li><p>processes: hiring, promotion (pay or title), professional
training, firing</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a government bureaucracy, pay and financial incentives are
typically set outside the organization.</p>
<p>The organization may have policies and processes regarding hiring,
promotion, training, and firing, but the decision may not be made by the
top-level management.</p>
<h4 id="not-many-options-for-teams">Not many options for Teams</h4>
<p>Team managers decide who gets hired and who gets promoted and who
goes to what training and who gets fired.</p>
<p>Among teams, interactions are either lateral (sideways) or
parent-child (top-down) or child-parent (bottom-up) <span
class="citation" data-cites="2014_Jorgensen">(Jorgensen, Bruehl, and
Franke 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>The child-parent bottom-up upward communication is either inadequate
(too few updates, or not enough information, or insufficient context),
relevant, or excessive. Finding the balance depends on the presenter
knowing the individual audience members so that a tailored message is
provided, and adapting to the specifics of the situation. A weekly or
monthly report to multiple superiors is inadequate.</p>
<p>The parent-child downward communication either is inadequate (no
direction), provides actionable vision, or micromanagement.</p>
<p>For lateral interactions among teams, the tension between cooperation
and competition manifest in struggles over</p>
<ul>
<li><p>money</p></li>
<li><p>staffing</p></li>
<li><p>prestige</p></li>
<li><p>products (output)</p></li>
<li><p>resources (inputs)</p>

<h2 id="bureaucracy-as-accidental-legacy-or-essential">Bureaucracy as
Accidental, Legacy, or Essential</h2>
<p><span data-acronym-label="essential bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">essential bureaucracy</span> is the
minimum processes and staffing and skills necessary to address the
complexity of the problem space. This is tricky since the optimization
can be with respect to resilience to change, resilience to edge cases,
staff turn-over, speed experienced by consumer, financial cost,
organization time, organization staffing level.</p>
<p>Undesirable bureaucracy is either accidental or legacy. Accidental
bureaucracy arises when someone misunderstands what is needed, or when
skills of the people involved are insufficient for the complexity a
problem. Legacy bureaucracy occurs when the situation changes but the
processes do not. Resolving each of these suboptimal conditions may seem
easy: have better knowledge of the problem, assign the right people to
the problem, and change processes as problems evolve.</p>
<p>Having sufficient knowledge is often infeasible, especially for
complex problems at large scale. Having the people with the right skills
assumes a pipeline of relevant talents and that people in that pipeline
won’t be poached for other problem. Keeping up with evolving problems
depends on having resources to change, and having a defined process for
changing process.</p>

<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
bad</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: when a person subjected to bureaucracy has
a negative experience, the easiest attribution is to the
least-understood aspect – the bureaucracy.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: <span data-acronym-label="bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucracy</span> is neither good
nor bad.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is an aberration, a
mistake, due to poor planning or incompetent
participants</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: TODO<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: TODO</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is
inefficient</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Expressed by both subjects and bureaucrats
who observe seemingly wasteful processes.<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: If bureaucracy were truly inefficient
(not allocating resources in the most efficient way), then it would be
replaced by a more efficient approach. The key is to ask, “efficient
with respect to what metric?” The metric of money, time, number of
people, stability, robustness to perturbation. Second, what would
motivate improved efficiency? Without incentives, change is less
likely.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is due to
malfeasance.</strong><br />
The specific number of malicious bureaucrats ranges from “all of the
participants” to “just enough to be problematic.”<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: There are bad actors. <em>What this is
missing</em>: Bureaucracy is unavoidable, and most of the participants
are earnestly trying to help or are not making a positive contribution.
Processes within bureaucracy are used to deal with malicious
bureaucrats, like isolation or promotion.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic fallacy</em>: <strong>Bureaucracy is a sign of decay
from within the org.</strong><br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: TODO<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Bureaucracy is unavoidable emergence in
any/every organization.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>If this request can’t be
expedited, it must not be important</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: Other people would demonstrate they care
about what I am working on by prioritizing things I am dependent on.
<em>What this is missing</em>: When everything gets prioritized, that’s
the same as nothing getting priority.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>Duration of a task is how long it
would take one person to accomplish</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: TODO<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Fails to account for the overhead of
interaction and delays due to asynchronous engagement.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>Consider the average or majority
(to the exclusion of outliers)</strong>.<br />
Why this simplification is misleading: For sufficiently large ensembles,
the outliers alter the outcome. The larger the ensemble, the more
significant the role of the outlier minority.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Bureaucratic Fallacy</em>: <strong>people learn from their
mistakes</strong>.<br />
<em>Why this feels true</em>: TODO<br />
<em>What this is missing</em>: Requires a low latency feedback loop and

unavoidable hazards in §<a href="#sec:unavoidable_hazards"

Given this nuanced view of the complexity of bureaucracy, how can you
leverage that insight?</p>
<p>Baseline assumptions are that you are a good person, you are
technically skilled at your technical duties, and you are a good project
manager.</p>
<p>Superpowers of a bureaucrat in a bureaucratic organization that
facilitate cooperation and progress:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You strive for and demonstrate transparency. You share
information with stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>You seek information from stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>You apply consistent processes (rather than being reactionary and
applying ad hoc responses).</p></li>
<li><p>You hold others (and yourself) accountable for their
actions.</p></li>
<li><p>You account for varying incentives and reference
experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>You communicate more effectively than anyone around you.</p></li>
<li><p>Your effectively multi-task, or, more accurately, switch tasks.
The switch among tasks is triggered when the current task encounters an
externally-generated pause. You can <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation">pipeline
your activities</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You are prepared with a backlog of ideas (in writing) if someone
shows up with resources.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dependent on someone else getting something done to
enable your progress, you can demonstrate priority by physically show up
– <u>presence creates priority</u>. Being physically at a person’s desk
motivates that person to respond better than calling them or emailing
them. Showing up where someone works and talking with them conveys how
much priority you place on the actions of the person you’re talking
with.</p></li>
<li><p>You reply quickly to incoming requests. This allows other
people’s tasks to either be resolved or have a clear response about when
progress can be expected.</p></li>
<li><p>You have intellectual empathy – theory of mind for thinking
(whereas empathy refers to emotions). How to grow your intellectual
empathy: shadow peers and bosses</p></li>
<li><p>You have process empathy. Observe deviations and exceptions that
cause processes to come into existence.</p></li>
<li><p>You avoid unintentionally dropping tasks or requests. This
requires capturing incoming requests and then providing a response about
prioritization and status. This matters because other participants in
the organization should regard you as reliable in a positive
sense.</p></li>
<li><p>You focus on value delivery in relationships that exceed the
scope of your formal role.</p></li>
<li><p>You have altered your job description to fit the growth you’re
seeking.</p></li>
<li><p>You are willing to engage on a personal level and know someone
outside their professional role.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of your tasks have a customer, a deadline, and a
deliverable.</p></li>
<li><p>You occasionally ponder and discuss with other people
introspective questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How can I be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways I could fail?</p></li>
<li><p>How the organization is regarded as successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the ways the organization can fail?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You find mentors and ask them questions like</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What do you like most about your career?</p></li>
<li><p>Given the chance, what would you do differently?</p></li>
<li><p>How do you manage work/life balance?</p></li>
<li><p>What’s the big challenge for our industry in the next two
years?</p></li>
<li><p>How would you tackle that challenge?</p></li>
<li><p>What advice do you have for a young person starting in this
industry? Mistakes to avoid? How to be successful?</p></li>
<li><p>What books would you recommend reading?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A bureaucrat can accomplish more as part of an organization than by
working alone. Being a member of an organization means the bureaucrat’s
identity is subsumed into service for the organization they are part
of <a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>. At the same time, bureaucracy
enables the bureaucrat to amplify their presence by being part of a
larger organization. Sometimes the cost of being part of the
organization exceeds the force multiplier of working together.</p>
<p>Measuring your own personal growth in a bureaucracy is difficult due
to the lack of feedback loops. One approach is to measure your
capabilities with respect to a specific task. If you can complete the
task in less time and with fewer resources and with less effort, that’s
progress. If you can now complete a task that you previously wanted to
but weren’t able to, that’s progress.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy induces emotional response in participants because things
don’t work they way each person wants. This can lead emotionally to
frustration and then apathy. Understanding how things operate in a
bureaucracy can help decrease the anger.</p>
<p>Another emotional response to bureaucracy is a sense of
powerlessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some third person decides your fate: this is the whole essence of
bureaucracy.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sense of powerlessness applies both to bureaucrats and to
subjects of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The sense of powerlessness is somewhat valid, in that you are as a
bureaucrat giving up some power compared to your ability to act
individually. That is the trade for working with others</p>
<p> <br />
A process feels bureaucratic when the subject is exposed to more than
one step to get something done that if one person were doing it would be
simpler. Consolidation from the subject’s perspective decreases the
apparent bureaucracy. The barrier to implementation is the necessary
coordination among different stakeholders who receive no benefit from
the coordination. Externalizing the coordination to the subject is what
causes the sense of bureaucracy.</p>
<p> <br />
Don’t rely on one person or one idea for your success. On the other end
of the spectrum, don’t spread yourself too thin.</p>
<p> <br />
What to do when you get stuck?<br />
look up stream, look downstream, look to peers</p>
<p> <br />
When you are asked to take on additional work, avoid responding with
“that’s not my job." If the request is misguided and your perception is
that is really is the responsibility of another person, ask if the
requester is aware of that other person’s responsibilities. If you are
to really take on the work, get guidance on re-prioritizing and make
sure the request is documented in writing.</p>
<p> <br />
If there’s something you want to accomplish, strive for influence
without authority instead of working to gain control over resources
(e.g., through promotion). Avoid the following: “In this organization X
is important to me, but I can’t do X right now because I don’t have
enough power in the org. So I’ll get promoted and then do X."</p>
<p> <br />
<em>TODO</em>: <strong>Learn the perspectives of those around
you.</strong><br />
The relevance of knowing the paradoxes including dilemmas and
unavoidable hazards, is that you should talk explicitly to your fellow
bureaucrats about these specific topics in conversation. Not that the
goal is to find consensus or agreement. But to find what the other
person is thinking so that you can account for their processes</p>
<p><em>TODO</em>: <strong>Account for holistic view</strong><br />
The specific circumstances of the challenges you face as a bureaucrat
depend on the individual people involved, what the purpose of the
bureaucracy is, what technology is available for implementation of
bureaucracy, and the resources (staffing, money, time).</p>
<p><em>TODO</em>: <strong>Learn the history of the
problem</strong><br />
This goes beyond Chesterton’s fence, which focuses about why the current
approach is in placed. Learning the history of a problem means what has
been tried before and failed? How did the previous iterations evolve
into the current situation? Was the cause personalities, insufficient
resources, inadequate technology? What’s changed that enables this
approach to be better? What do you know that prior attempts didn’t?</p>
<p><em>TODO</em>: <strong>Concurrently work on 3 remedies</strong><br />

<h2 id="subjects-view-of-bureaucracy">Subject’s view of Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:subjects-view" label="sec:subjects-view"></span></h2>
<p>When a person has a positive experience engaging with bureaucracy,
positive attribution is made to the people involved. Or the ease of a
solution makes bureaucracy less visible and the solution seems obvious.
When a person has a negative experience with bureaucracy, complaints are
about the incompetence of the people involved, or the
incomprehensibleness of the system. Don’t these bureaucrats know how to
do their job? Why isn’t the solution obvious? Why does this system not
work for me? David Graeber summarized this view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amongst working-class Americans, government is now generally seen as
being made up of two sorts of people: ‘politicians,’ who are blustering
crooks and liars but can at least occasionally be voted out of office,
and ‘bureaucrats,’ who are condescending elitists almost impossible to
uproot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scale of bureaucracy (number of people in an organization) and
the processes of an organization can seem disproportionate to the
apparent complexity of the task. Typically when person (in the role of
subject of bureaucracy) interacts with the bureaucratic organization the
artifacts are very simple – a check, a form, or a permit. The simplicity
of the artifact does not correlate to the number of decisions made, the
tracking of information, or the precautions taken. All these aspects are
invisible to the subject.</p>
<p>As an example, consider when you go to the doctor and they mend your
broken arm with a cast. That seems straight forward because all you see
is the doctor putting a cast on. You don’t get insight on the decisions
they had to make. Why did they need 20 years of focused schooling to
carry out a procedure that took 15 minutes?</p>
<p>Judging bureaucracy by the artifact visible to the individual subject
under sells the complexity of the decision making necessary to take
action. The contingencies that you were not exposed to because
everything went well make the amount of investment from the bureaucrat
appear wasteful.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you also lack the ability to
distinguish how much work is attributable to the bureaucrat generating
justifications for their actions (colloquially, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_your_ass">covering the
bureaucrat’s ass</a>).</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you typically can’t distinguish when
work is caused by a bureaucrat’s ill-informed decisions. Is the person
stupid, mistaken, or is there something you are not taking into account?
Sometimes the work is carried out by insufficiently trained bureaucrats,
but you don’t get to know whether you’re working with an experienced and
knowledgeable bureaucrat or a new untrained bureaucrat.</p>
<p>As the subject of bureaucracy, you don’t have visibility on the many
nuances of an organization. The internal power struggles and
organizational politics that depend on personalities, resources,
prioritization are not apparent to outsiders. The inconsistency of an
organization’s policies may not be felt by bureaucrats in that
organization. Each bureaucrat may have a different opinion, resulting in
a lack of consistent guidance. There may be legacy policies to
overcome/change/be consistent with.</p>
<p>Effective action by a bureaucratic organization is complicated by the
need for relevant information. Gathering, analyzing, and sharing that
information consistently requires bureaucratic processes. Sometimes the
organization lacks the staffing with relevant skills.</p>

<h2 id="bureaucrats-experience-of-dilemmas">Bureaucrat’s experience of
Dilemmas<span id="sec:dilemma_trilemma"
label="sec:dilemma_trilemma"></span></h2>
<p>When a decision has two viable options (neither being best), that
presents a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilemma">dilemma</a>.
The name for a decision with three viable options is a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilemma">trilemma</a>. This section
describes the bureaucrat’s experience of operating within an
organization in terms of dilemmas and trilemmas.</p>
<p>Dilemmas are a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning">simple way</a>
of discussing decisions but are not the only relevant aspect of
bureaucracy. Dilemmas are merely a useful framing to highlight the
following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You, an individual bureaucrat, face decisions that you may not
have recognized. Failing to recognize a choice can lead to suboptimal
results. The dilemmas below are generic to any bureaucratic process and
are intended to stimulate your ability to identify decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>You face complex trade-offs in your role as a bureaucrat.
Dilemmas are intended an entry point to more nuanced reflection that is
specific to your situation. The dilemmas below are not exhaustive; this
list is merely illustrative.</p></li>
<li><p>You can build <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind">intellectual
empathy</a> with fellow bureaucrats when you recognize they face the
same dilemmas. These dilemmas are generic to the situation and the
person facing the decisions. You now have a topic to discuss with
them.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be curious about the choice other bureaucrats select for
a given dilemma. Everyone in the organization faces these decisions, so
these dilemmas give you a topic of conversation to better understand
each bureaucrat’s view.</p></li>
<li><p>You can identify and negotiate potential sources of friction.
Other bureaucrats may arrive at different selections for a given
dilemma, so recognizing this and discussing it can improve the
effectiveness of all involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dilemmas explain the inherent complexity of bureaucracy even when
bureaucrats are honest and the purpose of the organization is clear. The
point isn’t that one should <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">select one of the two
options</a>. The point of recognizing a dilemma is that it is a marker
that there is a decision to be made. The action for the bureaucrat in
response to this assessment is to identify nuances, enumerate
alternatives, and talk with fellow bureaucrats about these decisions.
Rather than seeking consensus, strive for comprehension of other
people’s perspective. That way you can navigate processes more
effectively.</p>
<h3 id="how-dilemmas-arise-in-bureaucracy">How Dilemmas Arise in
Bureaucracy</h3>
<p>Given a task, the simplest response for an individual is to take
action and be done.</p>
<p>If the task is more challenging, it may be necessary to first make a
plan, then take action and be done. The source of the challenge may be
task complexity, scale, number of people impacted, diversity of
stakeholders, amount of time needed, how the current task shapes future
decisions, number of collaborators, etc. Regardless of why the task is
challenging, a dilemma has already arisen: how much time to spend
planning versus doing.</p>
<p>If the task is even more challenging, it may be useful to gather data
for the plan, then make a plan, then take action and be done. A new
dilemma arises: how much time to spend gathering data versus planning.
The previous dilemma still exists – planning versus doing. As an
alternative to the dilemma framing, how much time should be allocated to
three categories of activity?</p>
<p>But wait, how did the person in the first scenario (just do the task)
know no plan was necessary? Either it was an explicit choice or they
didn’t perceive the need to decide about whether to plan. Someone else
faced with that same task might choose differently, i.e., to make a
plan. The task complexity is relative to the person’s skills,
experiences, expectations about stakeholders, and potential
ramifications.</p>
<p>In this escalating sequence of increasingly challenging tasks,
suppose the task involves you and another person. The overhead of
coordination inflicts additional dilemmas. The examples of complexity
arising from coordination are identified in the list of dilemmas
below.</p>
<p>An independent source of friction is when people involved in the task
don’t agree on how challenging it is. The framing of the difficulty
matters because it can lead different participants to distinct
conclusions about how much time should be spent planning versus for
carrying out the action. The choice of “how complicated is the task?”
shapes the team dynamics and informs the need for hierarchical
roles.</p>
<h3 id="folk-wisdom-on-decision-making">Folk Wisdom on Decision
Making</h3>
<p>Bureaucrats, whether hired for their expertise or simply to provide
labor, are rarely experts on decision making. There are multiple domains
in which <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">decision making</a>
is studied (e.g., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">economics</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">mathematics</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making">psychology</a>),
but practicing bureaucrats are more likely familiar with colloquialisms
that feel descriptive. A few are provided here to give a sense of both
the conciseness and the lack of action embedded in each meme.</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law">Hick’s law</a>:
“Increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time
logarithmically.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlon’s
razor</a>: “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained
by stupidity.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s
law</a>: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its
completion.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy’s law</a>:
“Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”</p>
<p> <br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">Law of
Triviality</a>: “People within an organization commonly or typically
give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.”</p>
<p> <br />
In comparison to the folk expressions above, dilemmas are intended to be
accessible to practicing bureaucrats and trigger reflection and
discussion. Effective action is enabled by improved understanding of the
trade-offs faced within an organization.</p>
<h3 id="dilemmas-are-a-poor-framing">Dilemmas are a poor framing</h3>
<p>Although the following concepts are presented as dilemmas and
trilemmas, these are necessarily simplifications. For example, two ways
to simplify situations into a dilemma are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with a single variable, e.g., “how much data gathering",
and force it into a binary choice “more data gathering" versus “less
data gathering."</p></li>
<li><p>Start with a complex trade-off space with many opportunities and
reduce it to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_thinking">zero-sum
options</a>: “more data gathering" vs “more planning." The actual
trade-space involves optimization of multiple objectives, like (maximize
productivity) and (minimize risk) and (maximize quality) and (maximize
employee satisfaction) and (minimize latency).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These over-simplifications neglect both the continuous nature of the
trade-offs and the alternative creative approaches to a specific
situation.</p>
<p>The choices described below in the simplified representation of
dilemmas are intended as a starting point for introducing the decision
space relevant to individual bureaucrats. Do not accept the dilemmas
presented here as the final framing. Thinking in terms of a limited
spectrum of opportunities neglects nuances that enable more creative
approaches. Awareness of these dilemmas and trilemmas are intended to
spark creative imagination about the nuances specific to your
situation.</p>
<p>By recognizing the deficiencies of dilemmas, you can identify nuances
specific to the situation you are in. Instead of responding to the
recognition of a decision with “should I do this or that?” the better
option is to assess the complexities and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming">brainstorm</a>
multiple options. Talk with stakeholders and understand the history of
the situation before making a choice.</p>
<p>Ponder theses dilemmas prior to the pressure of real-time decision
making. Recognize dilemmas and trilemmas and then avoid them by adapting
to the local conditions and specific people available to help.</p>
<h3 id="dilemmas-are-not-purely-intellectual">Dilemmas are not Purely
Intellectual</h3>
<p>Decision making is not a purely intellectual task; there is emotional
stress induced by the process. Dilemmas create cognitive dissonance for
the decision maker. Any selection is going to have downsides, and any
compromise will be suboptimal. Those burdens weigh on deciders.</p>
<p>To counter this morale weight, talk with other people about
decisions. Even if this does not alleviate the responsibility of
deciding, discussion can help you arrive at new insights.</p>
<h3 id="additional-complications">Additional Complications</h3>
<p>Adding to the difficulty and stress, dilemmas presented here are
occur concurrently and continuously. The dilemmas are inter-dependent
due to both to the common variables and the constrained resources.
Selecting an option for one dilemma alters the options available in
other dilemmas.</p>
<p>Oscillation between approaches can be caused by change of management,
accumulation of experience (dissatisfaction) with one solution, the
desire for promotion (change as progress), or a desire for cost savings
(efficiency). The rate of oscillation is an indicator of the half-life
of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_memory">institutional
memory for an organization</a>.</p>
<p> <br />
The following two sections categorize dilemmas as personal policies (§<a
href="#sec:personal_policy_dilemmas" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:personal_policy_dilemmas">[sec:personal_policy_dilemmas]</a>)
and policies regarding structure of the organization (§<a
href="#sec:org_dilemma" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:org_dilemma">[sec:org_dilemma]</a>). The personal
policies apply to each bureaucrat in an organization, while the
structural policies for an organization are faced by a subset of
bureaucrats in the management role.</p>
<h3 id="personal-policy-dilemmas">Personal Policy Dilemmas <span

<p>In practice, the following decisions are unordered and are constantly
faced by the bureaucrat. As observed by Lindblom in <span
class="citation" data-cites="1959_Lindblom">(Lindblom 1959)</span>, this
flurry of decisions contrasts to a regularized process that might be
envisioned as optimal.</p>

<p>Making a decision imposes a bound on how much time is available for
both gathering data and planning. Time is zero sum, so more time
gathering data is less time planning. Similarly, the number of people

<p>Centralization is often carried out for the purposes of cost
efficiency. The cost savings are due to de-duplication and having less
slack. Both of those “savings” are a decrease of redundancy, which has a
cost when there are unexpected fluctuations in need.</p>
<p>Centralization is an intentional monopolization, with the
corresponding decrease in choices. Centralization (de-localization) can
decrease the value assigned to feedback from people using the service
because personal relations are de-valued.</p>
<p>The weaker feedback, lack of redundancy, and decreased emphasis on
relationships motivates the creation of local services.</p>

<p>There is a Goldilocks situation for amount of processes in an
organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Too few processes (all social relationships).</p></li>
<li><p>Just the right amount – a balance process and social, and when to
use which is known.</p></li>
<li><p>Too much process (not enough leveraging of social
relationships)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This optimization is similar to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">Laffer curve</a> in
economics.</p>
<p> <br />
Trilemma: <strong>Do you work for your team, your manager, or
yourself?</strong> Being a member of a team that operates within a
hierarchy is tough. One reason is the question of who you are working
for. The trilemma is whether you work for yourself, work for your
supervisor, or work for your team. Ideally you can find ways to do all
three, but that is not always the case.</p>
<p>Members of the team should work collaboratively, but there is a
potential counter-force: accountability to the supervisor. Because each
team member is accountable to their supervisor(s), that motivates the
action of the individual. The team does not actually have autonomy –
they are accountable to the boss.</p>
<p>In the approach “team members are directed by their supervisor," the
synergy of the team is neglected and the supervisor becomes a bottleneck
(for decision making and for creativity and for planning).</p>
<p>The third approach is for a person to ignore their team and their
supervisor. This might enable quicker progress, at the risk of going in
an unhelpful direction or not leveraging skills of coworkers.</p>
<p> <br />
Trilemma: <strong>Seek less budget, same, or larger budget.</strong>
Less budget is needed if you improved efficiency, but then the
proportional power within the organization is decreased. A larger budget
may be due to inefficiency or growth. Keeping the same budget indicates
no promotions are relevant (although a steady state could result from a
combination of growth and improved efficency).</p>
<p> <br />
A trilemma applicable to many situations is that options are
<strong>fast, inexpensive, good; choose two</strong>. (This is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Project
management triangle</a>.)<br />
In other words, the options are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Good and fast is expensive (i.e., requires lots of
resources).</p></li>
<li><p>Good and inexpensive takes a long time (i.e., a clever
solution).</p></li>
<li><p>Fast and inexpensive will be low quality.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="consequences-of-the-dilemma-based-framing">Consequences of the
Dilemma-based Framing</h4>
<p>The dilemmas listed above are numerous but not exhaustive. Even if
each bureaucrat considers the same choices (which doesn’t necessarily
happen), not everyone makes the same selection. One response might be to
defer to someone higher in the hierarchy to coordinate. While this would
ensure consistency, this would be <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement">micromanagement</a>.
The people in the hierarchy above the person facing the choice don’t
have exposure to the problem. Choices are delegated to leverage
expertise.</p>
<p> <br />
When you are facing these dilemmas and trilemmas there are constructive
responses that can improve your effectiveness. Improvement benefits your
results, your reputation, and the organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect quantitative data for each variable. Quantitative
arguments can augment qualitative stories.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct the Pareto frontier to identify non-optimal choices
that can be eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of assessing variables in isolation, assess consequences
in the context of workflows and impacts on stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss subjective decisions with stakeholders so that potential
disagreements can be negotiated instead of creating friction.</p></li>

<h2 id="unavoidable-hazards-of-bureaucracy">Unavoidable Hazards of
Bureaucracy<span id="sec:unavoidable_hazards"
label="sec:unavoidable_hazards"></span></h2>
<p>In a bureaucracy there are certain challenges that cannot be avoided.
The value of recognizing them is to understand that what you’re
experiencing isn’t an anomaly. The problem isn’t unique to you, your
circumstances, your coworkers, or the organization. The cause is the
combination of all those factors.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Separation of responsibility and accountability</strong>.<br />
Each bureaucrat in an organization has responsibilities associated with
their role. The ability to complete the tasks associated the role are
not wholly within the scope of the bureaucrat’s control. Even if there
is a desire for action, the action might not be immediately feasible
because of a dependence on another person or process.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Appreciation for being an effective bureaucrat is
rare.</strong><br />
If you do your job well, at best no one will notice.</p>
<p>“No one [thanks teachers] for policing cheating. Not the cheaters,
not the honest students who feel inconvenienced and mistrusted, and
certainly not the school [administrators] who have to process academic
dishonesty paperwork.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>The number of thank you cards sent to <a
href="https://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration</a> meat
inspectors, <a href="https://www.osha.gov/">Occupational Safety and
Health Administration</a> regulators, <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a>, <a
href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission</a>, and <a
href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> is
likely small.</p>
<p>There are counter examples in public service bureaucracy. Law
enforcement is thanked when there is a victim of a crime. The military
is held in high regard.</p>
<p> <br />
 <br />
<strong>Decision-makers are under-informed and
inexperienced.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Inability to gather data due to time constraints.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Defining success is subjective and dynamic</strong>.<br />
Who defines success and for which audience in a bureaucratic
organization is subjective because of the lack of feedback mechanisms.
Consequences may not be immediately obvious. Worse, how success is
defined can be changed at any time – there’s no need for
consistency.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Change threatens incumbents</strong>.<br />
Change of plans, roles, tasks, resources, flatness of org, scope,
technology</p>
<p> <br />
<strong><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility">Diffusion
of responsibility</a> in the bureaucracy</strong><br />
A specific task needs to be completed, and action requires involvement
of multiple collaborators.</p>
<p>Once responsibility is assigned, the new risk is that of blame.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Diffusion of blame in the bureaucracy</strong>.<br />
Example: if something goes wrong, who is at fault: the creator of a
policy or the person tasked with executing the policy?</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>High latency feedback</strong>.<br />
See §<a href="#sec:slow_deployment" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:slow_deployment">[sec:slow_deployment]</a> slow
deployment of processes and §<a href="#sec:decision-delay"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:decision-delay">[sec:decision-delay]</a> on decision
delay.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Weak feedback</strong>.<br />
Suppose my bureaucratic task depends on a service provided by you, a
fellow bureaucrat. If your computer isn’t working, your ability to
provide the service is blocked by a dependency on a computer repair
person. You might feel relieved – you can relax while you wait on the
computer repair and you don’t have to do work providing the service to
me. You might feel anxious – you’re unable to provide the service until
the computer is fixed. Regardless of how you feel about the situation,
my task is blocked. If neither you nor I have priority relative to the
computer repair person’s other tasks, then we wait. This question of
priority could be resolved hierarchically (for which there is limited
attention bandwidth) or socially (dependent on someone having a
relationship with the repair person).</p>
<p>The delay for my task may be sufficiently small that raising the
issue through the hierarchy or socially is not a good use of time.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>The person making the rules that you follow doesn’t actually
know what they’re doing</strong>.<br />
Your choices then include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow the rules that are not correct. This harms your
productivity and morale.</p></li>
<li><p>You can violate the rules and be more effective. This puts you at
risk for sanctions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can work the change the rules. Then you are not doing the
work that’s needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> <br />
<strong>You rarely get to pick who is on the team</strong>.<br />
When a task requires collaboration, there is rarely a choice of who you
get to work with.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Rarely able to alter team membership.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Inadequate resources: staffing, time, money.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Outcomes for the team are ill-defined and constantly
shifting.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>The organization has a lack of vision; or has vision but no
plan; or has vision and a plan but no consensus; or has vision and a
plan and consensus but inadequate resources.</strong></p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Progress depends on subjective decision making.</strong><br />
Rarely is the optimal path deterministic.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Easier to ask for big money than small money</strong><br />
Processes are scale invariant – Regardless of whether you’re asking for
$1000 or $100,000, the process is the same.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Flux of people and processes.</strong><br />
staff turn-over, changing conditions, changing timelines, change of
vision, and the need to be promoted. in a bureaucracy, consistency
doesn’t yield promotion.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Why are there so many rules?</strong><br />
To address edge cases and malicious or dumb people.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>So much paperwork/forms.</strong> Why is Red tape endemic to
bureaucracy?<br />
Paperwork as a form of coordination in processes to facilitate
decentralized decision making.</p>
<p>One of the motives for paperwork is to catch people who are
misrepresenting. Documentation makes prosecution more
straightforward.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Everything is slower.</strong><br />
What is meant is "slower than desired" or "slower than I imagined in my
simplified model"</p>
<p>One reason progress is slower than expected is because there aren’t
as many hours available as imagined.</p>
<p>In a bureaucracy the actual time spent working is less than the
number of hours you get paid for. Breaks during work, vacation from
work, holidays, sick leave.</p>

<p> <br />
<strong>Bureaucracy grows.</strong><br />
The causes of growth include scope creep, an increased number of people
participating in the process, an increased workload, or the ratio of
workers to managers decreases.</p>
<p>You can measure the growth of bureaucracy using metrics like the
latency in addressing a request and the number of people involved in
addressing a request.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing the size of a bureaucracy is easier than cutting
it down.</strong><br />
 <br />
<strong>The larger a hierarchy, the ratio of workers to managers gets
worse</strong>.<br />
As complexity and workload increase, the number of staff needed
increase. To facilitate coordination, managers arise. The amount of work
being done in a bureaucracy can be small compared to the number of
participants.</p>
<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig:growth_of_bureaucracy"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:growth_of_bureaucracy">3.6</a>a, the ratio of
workers to participants is 3:3=1. When a manager is added, the ratio is
3:4 = 0.75 (a lower value means less work per employee is being
accomplished). Adding a second team with dedicated management puts the
ratio at 6:9=0.66. Finally, with a dedicated administrative team (e.g.,
payroll, hiring, facilities), the ratio is 6:13=0.46.</p>
<p>Adding more people to a hierarchical organization results in
diminishing returns for time spent on the central work since bureaucrats
invest time maintaining the hierarchy and administrative processes.</p>

<p> <br />
<strong>Each person in a bureaucracy has multiple roles</strong>.<br />
To limit the expansion of the bureaucracy. The multiple roles come from
multiple relationships necessary to span an organization larger than <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s
number</a>.  <br />
<strong>Everything is more complicated</strong>.<br />
Bureaucracy administers access to resources, whether tangible items
(water, air) or expertise. There’s friction for tangible resources
because the easiest solution is you get the resource (without an
intermediary). There’s friction for expertise because the expert
understands things you do not.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Bureaucracy is inefficient and wasteful.</strong><br />
The inefficiency of an organization is not just due to a breakdown of
communication among its many members. Different individuals in different
roles faced distinct incentives and have a different view of what
problem is most relevant. There is a mixture of competition and
cooperation internally for resources.</p>
<p>Can you explain a Pareto frontier for multiple objectives like speed,
cost, accuracy?</p>
<p>Because decisions by bureaucrats are subjective, there is significant
risk of being wrong or being called out by others as being wrong.
Therefore, a motive to cover your ass for decisions made. Unnecessary
work is carried out.</p>
<p>Different participants have different motives, and the aggregation
needed for coordination is inefficient regardless of what metric
efficiency is measured against.</p>
<p>Another example: Inefficiency of changing the requirements on a
project partway through. If an objective quantitative measure were
available, the return on investment could be determined.</p>
<p>Efficiency is typically assessed from the perspective of a serial
process – a single worker could accomplish this task faster, so why
involve 10 people and get a slower, more burdensome result? The Mythical
Man Month manifests <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s law</a>.
Dividing a task among 10 people does not make the task 10x quicker. It’s
not valid to expect that a task which takes 1 person 1 hour to perfectly
scale so 10 people should be able to accomplish 10 results in 1
hour.</p>
<p>Inefficiency of process is similar. I need to file a request to
replace the lightbulb in my office. Compared to the serial “I’ll just
replace the lightbulb myself by running to the hardware store and
purchasing one."</p>
<p>The excess resources characterized as waste are similarly driven by
the serial-based assessment of what one person would require to carry
out the task.</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Scope creep.</strong><br />
The customer wants more, and the exploration of what’s possible is
exciting (a positive experience).</p>
<p>The creator hears more work. This implies a few trade-off options,
all of which are negative for one or both parties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sticking with the original terms (telling the customer "no",
which is negative for both parties)</p></li>
<li><p>re-negotiation for additional compensation (a burden to both

<p>The content of this book is independent of the specific role you as a
bureaucrat will be playing. I assume you are striving to be a good
person, and that you have relevant education/experience for the position
in the organization.</p>
<p>The reading lists <a

and managing</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-engineering-team-management">Engineering

Performance Organizations</a>, and <a
href="https://github.com/ankitjaininfo/awesome-managers">Managers</a>
are outside the scope of a guidebook for bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Reading management books is helpful regardless of whether you are a
manager, want to become a manager, or if you never want to become a
manager. In all three cases, gaining awareness of best practices and
alternative approaches benefits you as a bureaucrat and the people you
coordinate with – bosses, peer bureaucrats, subordinates, and
subjects.</p>
<p>In §<a href="#sec:hiring" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:hiring">[sec:hiring]</a> I narrate from both the
perspective of the person hiring and the person being hired. In §<a
href="#sec:promotion" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:promotion">[sec:promotion]</a> I describe the
incentives of the person promoting a bureaucrat and the person seeking
promotion. In §<a href="#sec:professional-training"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:professional-training">[sec:professional-training]</a>
I explain the relevance of training from the perspective of the employer
and the employee. My intent is to help both sides build empathy with the
other person’s experience.</p>
<h3 id="hiring-into-a-bureaucracy">Hiring into a Bureaucracy<span
id="sec:hiring" label="sec:hiring"></span></h3>
<p>Hiring shapes the culture of an organization and determines what is
feasible, both by the skills of those hired and how well new hires
integrate with the existing organization.</p>
<p>Hiring is an expensive process in terms of money, time, emotional
investment of candidates, and the burden of reviewing applicants. As a
candidate, recognize the risk the organization is taking. As a reviewer
of candidates, this is an investment in the future of the organization.
Even if your bureaucratic role does not require an exclusive focus on
hiring, there is value in studying this domain.</p>
<p>When hiring into an organization there is a selection bias in the
people who join a bureaucracy, and there is a selection bias who stays
in bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specifics of the job, there are specific attributes
that make a candidate more likely to be successful in a bureaucracy. In
addition to role-specific skills, hire for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>,
social skills, and intrinsic motivation.</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-getting-started">Tips for Getting Started</h3>
<p>Sometimes your role as a bureaucrat may be poorly defined. The lack
of direction or objectives may be feel disappointing or frustrating. The
positive perspective is that you get to define your tasks and determine
what would be useful or interesting.</p>
<p>Two mentalities that I find useful are enabling others and working
myself out of the job. My goal is to facilitate success rather than
being integral to the process. Enabling other people to be successful
can apply to customers, fellow bureaucrats, or management. Not everyone
matters equally, so figuring out the relevance of helping specific
people impacts your decision.</p>
<p>Another tactic I use is to look around, look backwards, and look
forward. What are the challenges my team or my organization faces? Then
review previous attempts to address the challenges. Why did previous
efforts fail to remedy the situation? Once I have a less naive view and
more context, what is my vision of the desired scenario? Without this
vision there is a danger of doing work that keeps me busy but yields no
progress.</p>
<p>The tactics of identifying challenges and learning the history of a
challenge often relies on social interactions. A bureaucratic
organization rarely maintains a searchable written record of decisions
and failed efforts. If that content is available, it may lack the
specificity available from oral narrative by people who were present.
When investigating issues in a bureaucracy, I end discovery-oriented
conversations with the question, “Who else should I talk to about this
issue?” Independent of the content or the quality of the content, this
question is the entry point to a large second-order social network of
expertise that is often separate from the hierarchical chain of command.
If multiple separate discussions lead to the same person, then that
person is key.</p>
<p>Documenting your process as you proceed helps both your
self-reflection and your ability to measure progress. Written
documentation of your status can be used as proactive updates to your
management and provides a record when someone asks retroactively why you
took certain actions.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic challenges that do not violate the constraints of Nature
(such as conservation of momentum, conservation of mass, speed of light,
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">Heisenberg
Uncertainty principle</a>) are solvable. There are typically political,
social, personality, security, and technical aspects that need to be
accounted for. Laws can be changed, regulations altered, people
replaced, and norms updated. Constraints that appear to be logically
inconsistent may be re-framed to be resolved. Narrowing or broadening
the scope may reset the context for a challenge.</p>
<h3 id="setting-your-emotional-state">Setting Your Emotional State</h3>
<p>As a member of a bureaucratic organization, you may feel the
frustration of bureaucracy, the happiness of success, the excitement of
possibilities, or the fear of uncertainty of operating in a complicated
environment. Your emotional state, whether set by your work or set by
events outside the bureaucracy, impacts your productivity and the
well-being of your coworkers.</p>
<p>You may see emotions as getting in the way of productivity and
creating problems, or emotions as unprofessional. This view is not
shared by everyone, and there are real benefits to feelings like
passion, enthusiasm, excitement, and joy. Yes, joy can be felt by
bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Expecting bureaucrats to be apply cold rational logic to decisions
and interactions is unrealistic. Openness to engaging emotional is more
constructive than avoiding or suppressing emotional aspects of the
job.</p>
<p>One source of emotions inspired by bureaucracy is when your roles,
responsibilities, and resources do not align. You want to be effective
and feel frustrated. This frustration can infect your interactions with
coworkers.</p>
<p>Another source of emotions in a bureaucratic organization is when you
observe someone else making what appears to be a poor decision or
policy. If you lack the ability to alter the decision or influence the
policy, this can feel disheartening or demoralizing. Worse, these
policies outside your control may impact you.</p>
<p>A third set of emotions in bureaucratic interactions occurs when a
group of bureaucrats with distinct perspectives, strong opinions, and
diverse experiences faced with complex challenges have insufficient time
to create consensus and select the optimal choice. Stress felt by each
participant impacts the interaction.</p>
<p>The relevance of these emotional states is that frustration and
stress can decrease your capacity for effective communication. Happier
bureaucrats can be more productive and collaborative.</p>
<p>By identifying these emotional patterns, the situation can seem less
personal. Your feelings are legitimate, but they are not unique to you.
Anyone in that situation is likely to feel similarly. Realizing this
helps build empathy instead of ignoring the feeling.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-failure">Learning from Failure<span
id="sec:learn_from_failure" label="sec:learn_from_failure"></span></h3>
<p>(This section on individual failure is separate from §<a
href="#sec:org_failure_and_success" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:org_failure_and_success">[sec:org_failure_and_success]</a>
on how an organization characterizes failure.)</p>
<p> <br />
Making progress in a bureaucracy is not a linear sequence of steps.
Ideally there is an on-going cycle of trying something, not succeeding,
and then applying what you learn towards the next attempt at trying
something. This idealized “fail fast” cycle does not occur naturally –
the participants have to either have intrinsic motivation or external
incentives to make progress.</p>
<p>The recognition of failure depends on a clear measurement. Do the
participants know the measure, and are they able to make the
measurement? Having a defined measure of failure and regularly making
the measurement relies on having an understanding of the expectations
for the situation. Expectations are assumptions about the future.</p>
<p>Assumptions about the future can be categorized as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>opinions. For example, interpretation of policy. Policy
interpretation can be bent or exceptions can be made.</p></li>
<li><p>guesses; more formally interpolation – given multiple options,
this seems most likely.</p></li>
<li><p>experience; more formally extrapolation – last time this happend,
so next time ...</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Failure with respect to expectations imply thinking about the future
so that you can measure your progress (or failure). That is a subset of
planning. You can fail if you don’t plan, and you can fail if you do
plan. This does not indicate that planning is irrelevant. Plans can be
overly detailed and prescriptive, or plans can be inadequately
specified; both are unhelpful.</p>
<p>If your measurements indicate failure, this could be due to an
invalid assumption (with a valid objective) or you may have selected a
bad objective. Declaring failure means re-evaluating assumptions,
resetting objectives, or giving up on the concept and doing something
else.</p>
<p> <br />
There are ways to avoid failing: by not setting an objective, or setting
an objective that isn’t measurable. You can avoid the appearance of
failure by not telling anyone the objective. Extrinsic accountability
for failure requires other people to have awareness. If these tactics
are being employed, it may be because the person (or, in §<a
href="#sec:org_failure_and_success" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:org_failure_and_success">[sec:org_failure_and_success]</a>,
the organization) doesn’t want to share how they’ve failed until they
have a success.</p>
<p>Understanding rationales like the failure avoidance mentality is
critical if you want to avoid feeling baffled the first time you
encounter it. By learning these bureaucratic anti-patterns, you can
inoculate yourself emotionally and cognitively. You now have a chance to
think ahead before encountering the explanation.</p>
<p>A counterargument when you hear that someone is avoiding failure is
to explain that noticing failure is essential to improving. Detecting
indicators of failure, addressing the cause, and then changing is the
process of improvement. When someone wants to avoid failure, I don’t
understand how they expect to improve.</p>
<h3 id="success-and-failure-in-your-organization">Success (and failure)
in Your Organization<span id="sec:org_failure_and_success"
label="sec:org_failure_and_success"></span></h3>
<p>This section on how a team or organization conceptualizes failure is
separate from §<a href="#sec:learn_from_failure"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:learn_from_failure">[sec:learn_from_failure]</a>
learning from failure as an individual bureaucrat.</p>
<p>Understanding the ways your organization succeeds or fails matters to
you because it impacts how you are evaluated and how you feel about your
work. Success and failure are measured with respect to a quantitative
objective.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations have varying definitions of success and
failure because organizations are made up of individual bureaucrats with
a multitude of motives and weak feedback mechanisms. There are a few
macro-level patterns for organizations. Each pattern has impact on the
individual bureaucrats operating within the organization.</p>
<p> <br />
A bureaucratic organization that provides infrastructure service (such
as public water utility, electrical power company, or an organization’s
internal computer support) has a specific failure mode. When
infrastructure is unavailable or degraded, that’s a failure. Success
means satisfactory operation at minimal cost. An organization operating
in this context is motivated to avoid failure. Success is merely a lack
of failure. An effort to improve processes or otherwise innovate will
face the inertia of a culture organized around avoiding failure.</p>
<p> <br />
A bureaucratic organization that claims “wins” but no failures (because
either more or different work needed) is difficult to be productive in
when the successful outcome has ill-defined value. The success can be
counted (number of wins), but the relative importance of the success is
unclear.</p>
<p>Examples of a win-focused organization include law enforcement,
research teams, and teams with a responsibility for innovation.</p>
<p>The funding for an organization focused on “wins” depends on how well
these successes can be sold as a narrative. This biases the organization
to focus on investments most likely to get more funding. Have the
funding organization is separate from the consumer of the “wins” yields
outcomes not helpful to the consumer.</p>
<p> <br />
A bureaucratic organization that works to improve the productivity of
other teams outside the organization may have neither successes nor
failures. Money and time are invested with the hope that results are
useful to someone at some future time. If the organization didn’t exist
no one would be significantly impacted.</p>
<h3 id="promotion">Promotion<span id="sec:promotion"
label="sec:promotion"></span></h3>
<p>Bureaucrats get promoted for multiple reasons: due to their technical
competence, their managerial capability, or to get them out of the
way.</p>
<p>***************</p>
<p>Promotion typically focuses on the successes of the individual. This
deemphasizes teamwork and lessons learned from failures. Lowering the
value of learning from failures increases risk aversion. The risk
tolerance of a bureaucratic organization is driven in part by tensions
in the promotion processes: an interest in success (more success is
better) and avoidance of failure. This imbalance can lead seeking
ownership of efforts that are likely to succeed, seeking easier
successes, and afterwards stealing credit for outcomes created by other
people.</p>
<p>***************</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">Peter
principle</a>: “people in a hierarchy tend to rise to "a level of
respective incompetence": employees are promoted based on their success
in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer
competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to
another.”</p>
<p>This might manifest as recurring failure. More likely, your
incompetence will blind you to your own failures.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to the peter principal, do not promote unless
the employee has a track record of performing at the next promotion
level. The downside is that the employee is working at a discounted rate
since they are providing value beyond what is expected of their
grade.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_principle">Dilbert
principle</a>: “systematically promote incompetent employees to
management to get them out of the workflow.”<br />

Law</a></p>
<p>Peter principal <span class="citation" data-cites="1970_Peter">(Peter
1970)</span> has an element of truth, especially initially in a person’s
assumption of a new role. However, a person can learn their role and
become competent. Also, the Peter principles relies on the
simplification of a single dimension of intelligence. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">Gardner’s
theory of multiple intelligences</a></p>
<p>Promotion is a critical aspect of designing incentives for behavior.
Promotion is central because there are a variety of motives – for money,
for status, for authority.</p>
<p>promotion of individual (rather than team) results in hero
culture</p>
<p>What is preventing innovation is lack of risk taking. Actual risk
means potential for failure. fear of failure because culture avoids
failure due to concerns of waste. Also, anyone who fails can use this
argument, but that isn’t the same as “fail fast” because what’s critical
is learning from failure and sharing that insight gained so other’s
don’t need to repeat.</p>
<p>two options for learning: your own mistakes, or the mistakes of
others. "formal education" is about the latter</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat interested in improving your organization, exit
interviews can help identify weaknesses.</p>
<h4 id="organization-chart-orientation">Organization chart orientation
<span id="org-chart-orientation"
label="org-chart-orientation"></span></h4>
<p>A common method of describing relations within the bureaucracy is the
organization chart (colloquially, the “org chart"). Normally the CEO is
at the top of the chart, middle management is in the middle, and managed
employees are at the bottom. See Fig. <a
href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">4.1</a></p>
<p>An organization’s culture is subtly conveyed by artifacts like org
charts. There are emotional connotations to alternative layouts. You can
alter expected relations (culture and norms) by playing with orientation
of the org chart. Org chart orientation can be overanalyzed, so this
exploration is limited.</p>
<p>The point of thinking about org chart orientation is to frame how you
perceive your supervisors, peers, subordinates. Notice that the framing
is embedded in the words – prefixes super (over) and sub (under). These
concepts inform what you expect from relations. Do I seek support or
direction and guidance from my boss? What do I expect from my boss,
peers subordinates? What do I expect to provide them?</p>
<p>The relative orientation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer">CEO</a> to
workers sets expectations for relations. Options for orientation are the
conventional CEO at top (Fig. <a
href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-top">4.1</a>), CEO at the
bottom (Fig. <a href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-bottom"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-at-bottom">4.2</a>), CEO on
the right (Fig. <a href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-leads"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-leads">4.3</a>), CEO on the
left (Fig. <a href="#org_chart_orientation_ceo-follows"

data-reference="org_chart_orientation_ceo-follows">4.4</a>), CEO as the
center of a star (Example: <a

intended to fill that gap.</p>
<h2 id="you-are-an-individual-in-an-organization">You are an Individual

<p>This section focuses on the individual bureaucrat operating within an
organization.</p>
<p>There is no neutral member of a bureaucracy. Either you are
contributing to the organization, or you are sapping resources from the
organization. This is because the organization operates in a zero-sum
game for resource allocation.</p>
<h3 id="ideas-for-innovation-within-a-bureaucracy">Ideas for Innovation
within a Bureaucracy<span id="sec:innovation"
label="sec:innovation"></span></h3>
<p>The innovation lifecycle in a bureaucracy is</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You observe problems and challenges in your environment. This
manifests as complaints from both the people directly harmed and
observers who see inefficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>You share ideas for innovation and gets feedback. Build a
coalition of people willing to fight for the idea on your behalf so that
when you’re not present, the idea is still proceeding towards
implementation. That puts the threshold at “so important other people
are willing to pause whatever they were working on and take up your
cause.”</p></li>
<li><p>Implementing these suggestions require either a change to
existing processes or new processes or an investment of work. These
changes may not succeed – there’s risk. Your idea could fail because
it’s not a good idea. It could also fail because someone doesn’t like
you, or the idea doesn’t account for some dependency you weren’t aware
of, or it might conflict with other changes in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>If you do decide to invest effort, the activity takes you away
from your current work. Implementing the change might involve skills you
don’t have; learning those skills takes time. Carrying out the activity
with new skills increases the likelihood of novice mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone else implements the idea they get the credit for
having done the work.</p></li>
<li><p>If the idea saves money or time, there’s typically no monetary
reward. Recognition and benefit to your reputation isn’t required as
part of the change process.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are many barriers in that lifecycle. The problem has to be
observable to someone willing to invest effort in change. That person
has to build a coalition of stakeholders. If the person isn’t negatively
harmed, that person may also lack clear benefit from resolving
inefficiency.</p>
<p>In addition to the work of implementing the change, there is an
administrative overhead of documenting the reason for the change.
Subjective decisions mean choices have to be defensible. The need for
defensible justifications result in conservative decisions and risk
aversion and a decrease of motive for innovation.</p>
<p>These barriers lead to external observers to conclude something like
the following simplification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats
hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better
results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top
of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept?<a href="#fn22"

<h3 id="creating-change-in-the-organization">Creating change in the
organization<span id="sec:creating_change"
label="sec:creating_change"></span></h3>
<p>If the organization you are a participant in has no problems or
challenges, this subsection can be skipped. For bureaucrats in
organizations that do have structural problems, this part of the
guidebook provides points to ponder independent of the specific
problem.</p>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you have unique insight on the problems the
organization faces, and you have unique leverage to alter the situation.
While you could proceed haphazardly, an effective bureaucrat has vision,
goals that break down the vision, plans on how to achieve each goal, and
milestones which indicate whether the plan is proceeding.</p>
<p>Perspectives to consider when assessing change include what the
situation is, what the situation could be, and what the situation looks
like from different stakeholders.</p>
<p>Confounding your ability to improve the organization, there are
people around you who have conflicting visions or no vision. There are
different views on whether something is actually a problem, different
prioritizations, and different approaches to addressing problems.</p>
<p>A trade-off to consider is that having niche impact is easier than
broad change. There’s also a trade-off of the quick fix versus more
robust solutions.</p>
<p>For a given structural problem in an organization, options include
technical solutions, changing policy, or changing cultural norms of
participants.</p>
<p>determine social/political/technical impediments.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Before starting a new effort, check to see whether this
has been tackled before. Learn the history of the problem. Why hasn’t
this been solved?</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Query your first and second order social network.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: get feedback early before polishing</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: advertise the result.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: hear criticism and respond</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: leverage both social networks and bureaucratic
processes.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Professional respect (for what the other person knows)
and professional curiosity (for what you don’t know)<br />
Example: Getting approval from multiple overseers in different
hierarchies is hard. Often different objectives and incentives.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Use social recommendations to identify relevant
individuals. Leverage the trust already in their social network by
starting with “Person A recommended I talk to you about X."</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Sit in on meetings, listen to topics, see who is
talking, who is attending. After the meeting talk to individuals about
the meeting. Set up one-on-one informal discussions. Keep the first
conversation brief - 10 or 15 minutes. Your body language should
indicate engagement and interest. “Who else would you recommend talking
to?" is the last question in the first conversation.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: Consensus doesn’t mean everyone agrees on the problem,
the remedy, or the approach, or who’s taking the action. Consensus in a
bureaucracy means people aren’t going to resist the change.</p>

<h3 id="measuring-bureaucratic-maturity-of-bureaucrats">Measuring
Bureaucratic Maturity of Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic maturity of bureaucrats in an organization can be broken
into three behaviors:</p>
<p>The first and most wide spread behavior is to observe a problem and
then complain about the situation. This indicates awareness of the
environment but no creativity regarding what to do about the
problems.</p>
<p>The second, less common behavior, is to observe a problem and
recognize the situation as an opportunity. This requires creativity and
reframing.</p>
<p>The third behavior is to observe a problem and then nudge the
situation towards a vision. The nudges could be through either direct
action or by influencing others.</p>
<p>An individual bureaucrat can exhibit one or more of these behaviors.
That is, being capable of the third behavior does not mean the person
lacks the ability to complain on other topics.</p>
<p>There is not a specific amount of experience within the organization
needed to arrive at any of these three paradigms. A holistic
understanding of the system certainly helps.</p>
<p>The “vision" of the third behavior could be in the form of a
long-term (temporally distant) outcome, or the vision could be of
immediate multi-party cooperation.</p>

<p>Loss of independence within the org (deindividuation) is either

<p>If everyone participating in a process thinks they are doing the
right thing, then why are there suboptimal outcomes?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each participant may have limited view of other parts of the
process</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has limited scope of
responsibility</p></li>
<li><p>Each participant typically has limited scope of
authority</p></li>
<li><p>participants typically have insufficient time, resources, and
expertise</p></li>
<li><p>participants may have a common objective, but different methods
for addressing the challenges</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you engage with fellow bureaucrats, what you are providing is
your time, attention, and alertness. To illustrate the relevance of
those aspects, consider the following. I can talk to you for 15 minutes
of time, but if your attention is directed towards your phone, then
you’re not fully engaged with me. If you are paying attention during the
time we have together but you haven’t slept for 36 hours, then your
alertness may not be 100%.</p>

<p>Solo work may be more emotionally rewarding due to fewer external
constraints, but the cost is complexity and scope being limited to the
skills of the individual.</p>
<p>Working with others allows you to occasionally accomplish complex
results beyond your own skills or your own bandwidth in spite of
collaborators not being under your control. How? Through persuasion.</p>
<p>The challenge of collaboration is to multiply productivity rather
than merely sum the output of a set of individuals.</p>
<p>inside an organization, cooperation/coordination is not held together
by internal contracts or even service level agreements. What holds the
organization together? Force of will of participants.</p>
<p>two networks: formal and informal</p>
<h3 id="motivation-of-bureaucrats">Motivation of Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>To understand the bureaucrats you work with, appreciating their
diverse motives is instructive. If you expect everyone to have the same
motives as you, then you will be surprised by the friction.</p>
<p>Motivations of participants are rarely “how can I make the company
more successful" or even “how can I sell/produce more product"? Usually
motivation is based on personal success in various manifestations, which
leads to emergent phenomena which appears confounding to observers
outside the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Each bureaucrat has a motive, even the bureaucrats who do nothing. In
an organization where you are a paid bureaucrat, you are either actively
working for improvement of the organization, or your existence is
parasitic to the organization. There is no “idle" status for paid
employees in an organization with limited resources.</p>
<p>Not too efficient such that I eliminate the need for my job, and not
so inefficient that the organization fails and I lose my job. Increasing
the efficiency of bureaucracy is good for the organization and the
outcomes, but can be harmful to the bureaucrat’s career.</p>
<p>Career stability within an organization is a benefit, and it can be
leveraged to take more risk. However, it typically manifests as inaction
by an employee. There’s no harm to the employee in not taking action. If
an employee doesn’t do anything, nothing bad will happen to that
employee. Career stability decreases extrinsic motivation.</p>
<p>Example motivations for bureaucrats: stability, money, travel,
problem solving, like being associated with org, logistical convenience
(“the office is near where I lived.”)</p>
<h3 id="tropes">Tropes<span id="sec:tropes"

managers who are removed from challenges and deny the problem is a

didn’t succeed, and are emotionally beaten down such that they no longer
try * the Patriot who is willing to sacrifice for the organization *
mismatched – person’s skills and interests don’t match their role, so
they are despondent and frustrated. * friendly grouch: friendly and
helpful but unhappy in their job due to bureaucracy and other hurdles. *
detail-oriented: ask them what time it is and they’ll tell you how to

<h3 id="not-my-job-task-scope">Not my job: task scope</h3>
<p>If I ask someone for help on a task that benefits the team, that
person might respond that the task is “not my job" and time spent on
tasks like that “gets in the way" of their progress. The interesting
(emotionally rewarding) work is not that task.</p>
<p>“ ‘<a
href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scut">Scut</a>’’
is medical slang for the non-clinical yet essential tasks that do not
require a doctor’s degree or expertise." This is different from
administrivia (administrative tasks) as “scut” would include taking out
trash.</p>
<p>“once I realized someone else has the same problem, I stopped
worrying about it.” Same as “not my job"</p>
<p>The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>will not get them promoted</p></li>
<li><p>scope of their job and their expertise does not include the
task</p></li>
<li><p>they don’t know how to do the task and they don’t want to
learn</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, the individual’s “progress" is not aligned with the
success of the team.</p>
<h3 id="building-managing-and-spending-reputation">Building, Managing,

<p>Managing reputation means acknowledging that your interaction with

<p>Reputation matters for influence. How other people perceive you
impacts what you can accomplish and when people seek out your help or
input.</p>
<p>Your reputation is actively changing based on your activities and
communication – both your communication and the stories others tell
about you.</p>
<p>Neglecting to manage your reputation means you lose input to the
stories others tell about you. Active management of your reputation
requires engaging people and generating evidence.</p>
<p>Reputation is set whenever and where ever you are observed, or
artifacts are associated with you. What you wear, when you show up, how
your emails appear, body posture in meetings.</p>
<p>Reputation is perception of the person the bureaucrat is engaging
with. What does that person think of you?</p>
<p>Ideally that would be a function of their technical skill, ability to
collaborate with other people, the strength of their network,
creativity. None of this matters if the person you’re engaging with
doesn’t know those things.</p>

Subdivisions of an Organization</h3>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="2015_Katzenbach">(J. R. Katzenbach
and Smith 2015)</span></p>
<p>In the context of altering teams, there are a few major levers
available: create new team, merge teams, dissolve a team.</p>
<p>For a given set of teams, the lateral interactions are competitive or
cooperative. Coordination is required (or conflict will occur) for
money, staffing, and resources. Examples of resources include access to
or control of data, computer equipment, hardware, floor space, prestige,
products (output).</p>
<h4 id="roles-of-management-versus-leadership">Roles of Management
versus Leadership</h4>
<p>Teams include managers and leaders. Those roles are not necessarily
the same person.</p>
<p>A manager’s role involves time management, task tracking, employee
evaluations, promotion, pay, requesting resources for team members, and
hiring.</p>
<p>A leader’s role focuses on coordinating vision and principles. The
vision and principles do not have to originate from the leader – other
team members can contribute ideas. The leader’s responsibility is
primarily social consensus.</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-empathy">Intellectual Empathy</h3>
<p>As a bureaucrat, you will work with people who are smarter on a
specific topic than you are. That superior knowledge might come from
experience or from formal education.</p>
<p>The person with superior knowledge may be able to convey their
knowledge to you, or they may struggle to. That struggle could be due to
an inability to break down complex insights, or they don’t recognize the
mismatch between what they know and what you understand. This same
scenario can be reversed – you might be more knowledgeable on a given
topic than some other bureaucrat you work with. In either situation,
both parties have responsibilities of intellectual empathy. The more
knowledgeable person needs to understand what they can build on when
talking with the less knowledgeable person, and the less knowledgeable
person has to be clear about what is making sense and what does not.</p>
<p>I often start conversations with people who are new to me by asking
about their professional background – their education, past work
experience, and other aspects that would allow me to build on their
existing knowledge. This allows me to tailor the conversation to the gap
of knowledge that exists when we are discussing a challenge.</p>
<p>During a conversation you can monitor body language for reactions
like a squint, a head tilt, an eyebrow raise or an eyebrow furrowed.
Those are common reactions when information doesn’t conform to what the
listener was expecting.</p>
<p>A more direct method is to ask about the other person’s knowledge
about the topic. The phrasing “Do you know about (name of topic)?” is
less effective than “What do you know about (name of topic)?”
Respondents might claim experience or knowledge of a topic, but probing
for the difference between “I’ve heard those words before” versus “I was
part of a team that implemented (topic)” versus “I came up with the
original idea for (topic)” is helpful.</p>
<p>Sometimes the person with less knowledge on a topic feels
uncomfortable with indicating their confusion, or sometimes the person
doesn’t realize they are missing the main point. The more knowledgeable
person can check in with the listener to confirm. “What did you get from
what I just talked about?” is a better confirmation than “You understood
what I meant, right?” The person with less knowledge can proactively
check their knowledge by providing a read-back: “Here’s what I
understood you to mean: ...” These check-ins, regardless of who
initiates, should be relatively frequent when exploring complex
topics.</p>
<p>Admitting ignorance can be intimidating and may feel like you risk
losing the other person’s respect. A more gentle way of saying “I’m
lost” is “I was following up until the point where you described ...”
Intellectual empathy is the responsibility of both parties in a
conversation.</p>

<p>Don’t measure things otherwise you’ll be held accountable for
them.</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>In the following two sections two viewpoints are described: that of
an expert providing help and that of a bureaucrat needing expert
help.</p>
<h4 id="for-experts-looking-to-help-non-expert-decision-makers">For
experts looking to help non-expert decision makers</h4>
<p>Non-experts think and speak less precisely</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>You, the expert, may not win any debates based on number of years of
experience. Some audiences may have many years in the field. However,
expertise (rather than experience) is what they can benefit from.</p>
<p>Identify which party (you, the expert, or the audience) has broader
diversity of situations.</p>
<p>respect and account for the expertise of the audience (especially
when they work in a different field). Acknowledge your own limits.</p>
<p>Don’t rely completely on expertise as a single dimensional relation.
Find ways to relate personally to audience members. They will need to
build trust in you personally.</p>
<p>Facilitate the audience setting the goals. They should be able to
identify how success is defined.</p>
<p>Identify strengths your audience has and build on those.</p>
<p>You don’t have to teach a group all-at-once. One-on-one teaching is
more customizable, and the audience may feel less worried about asking
dumb questions.</p>
<p>Once you’ve taught more than one person, they can help each other
translate the skill.</p>
<h4 id="for-non-experts-looking-for-expertise">For non-experts looking

<p>Experts may lack experience communicating their knowledge.</p>
<p>Experts are cautious to include caveats and limitations</p>
<p>Translation process is necessary from "here’s what’s known in
general" + "situation specific facts" to "plan of (in)action" and what’s

<p>Experts straying outside their expertise are dangerous because the
boundary may not be clear to the audience.</p>
<p>*************</p>
<p>How to recruit an advisor if you don’t have expertise yourself:
triangulate. Seek guidance from your existing social network. Advisor
should be opinionated (not meek) but adaptive to new information.</p>
<h3 id="does-anyone-want-to-volunteer">Does anyone want to
volunteer?</h3>
<p>Meeting facilitator asking, "Does anyone want to volunteer for this
task?" to a group will most often be met by silence. The lack of
engagement can be addressed by not asking for volunteers. The outcome
can be higher engagement with the following tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Ask each person whether they are attending to observe or to
volunteer.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person how much time they are willing to volunteer.
Responses could be 0, or 1 hour (non-recurring), or 1 hour per month, or
something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what their goals in the interaction are. It is
usually generic ("I want the group to succeed.") but it can be narrow,
in which case that gives you something to focus on.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask each person what they are good at and what skills they have.
Are they good with personal interaction? Writing? Computers?
Coordinating? Logistics? Fund raising? Making phone calls?</p></li>
<li><p>From the inventory of tasks, are there any that fit both the
skills and time? Can the task be scoped to fit the time? If there are
multiple candidate tasks for a volunteer, let them pick the task. (If
there is no existing task that aligns with their skills, do not create
work to be assigned.)</p></li>
<li><p>If there are other volunteer working the same tasks, put them in
contact with the other participants</p></li>
<li><p>Give the volunteer a deadline for the task. The deadline should
not be arbitrary – the deadline should be based on the dependent
follow-on tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm that the volunteer is willing to commit the time to
complete the tasks by the deadline</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule a check-in with the volunteer before the task deadline
to review progress</p></li>
<li><p>To create accountability among multiple volunteers, hold a group
review to explain how each participant’s work contributes to the goals
and how work done by one person enables the next task done by someone
else. (Enumerate the dependency graph; include deadlines.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="communication-within-a-bureaucracy">Communication within a
Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Poor communication yields poor negotiation. Then the interaction
defaults to an emotional struggle of will power</p>
<p>In this book I don’t address paper memos versus email versus phone
calls versus video chat versus Skype versus Slack. The relevant
attributes are agnostic to specific technologies and implementations:
synchronous versus asynchronous; discoverable or not discoverable;
searchable or not searchable.</p>
<p>Communication within a bureaucratic organization occurs on a gradient
of how official the information is. Examples of the gradient ordered
from unofficial to official:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I just made this up and I have no authority</p></li>
<li><p>Based on my experience, ...</p></li>
<li><p>Based on my training, ...</p></li>
<li><p>I heard from someone else (folklore from a peer)</p></li>
<li><p>I heard from someone in a position of authority</p></li>
<li><p>Referencing a written document</p></li>
<li><p>Referencing a written document that looks official</p></li>
<li><p>Referencing a written document that looks official with the
signature of a position of authority</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These indicators convey the relative importance of information for
the bureaucrat.</p>
<p> <br />
Information within a bureaucracy shapes the relationships of
bureaucrats. That spans from not sharing information (which can harm or
protect relationships) to being transparent to being vulnerable. Being
transparent conveys “here’s what is happening." Being vulnerable expands
that to “here’s why that’s happening or what might happen."</p>

<h3 id="why-of-communication-within-a-bureaucracy-matters">Why of

<p>Taking action informed by locally-available information can produce
suboptimal results for participants, as illustrated by the <a

dilemma</a>. Communication among bureaucrats facilitates delegation of
work, allocation of resources, relationship creation/maintenance, and
carrying out processes. Communication has a cost for participants: time

<li><p>Life sucks but I get a pay check</p></li>
<li><p>I quit (in hopes of being more successful somewhere
else)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="communication-preferences">Communication Preferences</h3>
<p>There are typically multiple communication channels available between
bureaucrats in an organization. Rather than focus on specific
implementations using specific technologies, consider two variables. The
first variable is asynchronous versus synchronous. Examples of
asynchronous communication channels include voice mail, email, web
forums, web sites, calendars. Synchronous options include phone calls,
video calls, in-person, text-based chat like IRC or Slack. The
distinction between these can be blurry, like if someone immediately
replies to your (asynchronous) email. The second variable is a set of
categories: voice (e.g., phone), text (e.g., website, web forums,
calendars), video (e.g., calls), and in-person.</p>
<p>The lack of equivalence can be seen in comparing text with audio
which has been converted to text. In addition to the text transcription,
voice audio also has inflection, volume, volume variation, rate, rate
variance.</p>
<p>The relevance to a bureaucrat of identifying these channels is to
know which channel is preferred for what purpose. To be an effective
bureaucrat there are reciprocal actions. First, you should list your own
preferences so that people know how best to engage with you. Second, you
should learn and then leverage the preferences of individuals you
collaborate with.</p>
<p>As an example of knowing your own behaviors, do you keep your
calendar up-to-date? Or is your calendar irrelevant? Is that preference
stated explicitly to the people who might reference your calendar? Is
your calendar visible to your coworkers?</p>
<p>Text chat is useful for asynchronous interrupts. Text chats are
better than stopping by in person or calling on the phone since
in-person drive-bys and phone calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking
about or discussing. The purpose of the text chat is either a reminder
or seeking a convenient time to talk.</p>
<p>Email is useful for notifications or questions or setting up
logistics. If I don’t respond to a question or request for action within
2 days, please send a reminder.</p>
<p>Video calls are my preferred method for group meetings. Group
meetings via video call scheduled in advance on my calendar are best.
Impromptu video calls are acceptable but as interruptive as a phone
call.</p>
<p>In-person discussions are my preferred method for one-on-one
discussions. Stopping by my desk without an appointment interrupts
whatever I’m thinking about. If a calendar invitation is inconvenient, a
text chat confirming my availability prior to the in-person discussion
is helpful.</p>
<p>Phone is useful when the caller is unable to be present in-person.
Phone, being voice-only, is inferior to video calls. Unscheduled phone
calls interrupt whatever I’m thinking about. I’ve intentionally disabled
voicemail.</p>
<p>Status updates in electronic issue trackers or wikis or forums are
best (rather than email-only). Notifying in text chat or email that a
wiki page or issue is updated is helpful but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Given all those caveats, I prefer communication in any form at any
time over surprises.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure whether you should communicate, default to
communicating. If you’re not sure whether communication would interrupt
something, check my calendar and then communicate. If it’s urgent or
blocking progress, ignore my calendar.</p>
<p>Know when to switch communication channels. When to start in one
channel and then escalate. Text to phone to in person</p>
<h3 id="social-and-bureaucratic-interactions">Social and Bureaucratic
interactions<span id="sec:socializing"
label="sec:socializing"></span></h3>
<p>Interactions with other people in an organization are either social
interaction or bureaucratic interaction.</p>
<p>As examples of each of these,</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Social interaction example</em>: “Did you see the game on TV
last night? Our team really did well, right? I thought about getting
tickets for the game but they were sold out."</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bureaucratic interaction example</em>: “You’ll need to get
approval from Sue before presenting your idea to the board for their
review. Then talk with Russ and get his thoughts."</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Both social and bureaucratic interactions are vital to cohesion in an
organization of people.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic interaction can be broken into two subcategories: <span
data-acronym-label="visible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">visible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are written down and can be discovered by
stakeholders) and <span data-acronym-label="invisible bureaucracy"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">invisible bureaucracy</span>
(procedures and processes are known to some stakeholders and are
conveyed verbally to some of the other stakeholders).</p>
<p>Invisible bureaucracy is akin to invisible domestic or relation work
outside the professional environment. The work associated with emotional
cohesion, logistics, planning, scheduling, and communicating is hard to
quantify so it does not get counted.</p>
<p>Processes default to invisible bureaucracy because documentation and
discoverability require work, and because some processes are
embarrassingly inefficient.</p>
<p>To make invisible bureaucracy visible, document the work.</p>
<p>The relevance of this jargon is to break down the components of an
organization’s “culture" experienced by participants. The ratio of
social relationship to visible bureaucracy to invisible bureaucracy is a
characterization of the culture. There are norms associated with each of
these three categories.</p>
<h3 id="communication-tips">Communication Tips</h3>
<p>The role of verbal communication is critical for bureaucrats. There
is a lot of advice on effective communication (enunciate, speak loud
enough to be heard, be humble, be curious), so the advice below is
highlighted because of prevalence in bureaucratic organizations. The
following is generic to interactions outside of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>For general writing tips, see Strunk’s and White’s Elements of Style
and other resources <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p>
<h4
id="tip-not-all-interaction-challenges-are-communication-problems.">Tip:
Not all interaction challenges are communication problems.</h4>
<p>Sometimes an inability to discuss ideas is not a communication
problem but a psychological deficit of personality. Distinguishing “I’m
an ineffective communicator” from “the person I’m talking with doesn’t
communicate effectively” from “that person has a diagnosed psychological
reason they are unable to communicate” is tough for those of us who are
not psychologists or psychiatrists.</p>
<h4 id="tip-avoid-relying-on-stereotypes.">Tip: Avoid relying on
stereotypes.</h4>
<p>Within an organization different teams may build up reputations for
certain behaviors, or there may be significant events that the team is
associated with. When interacting with members of a team that has a
reputation, avoid relying on that stereotype or event as an opening for
discussion. You’re speaking to an individual, so address that person’s
behavior.</p>
<h4 id="tip-avoid-questions-that-have-a-binary-response.">Tip: Avoid
questions that have a binary response<span id="sec:yes_no_questions"
label="sec:yes_no_questions"></span>.</h4>
<p>Responding to a request with “no” is advantageous for the person
replying to the question. There is less work required, less risk of
failure, and better continuity. As an example of a poorly framed
question, I could ask, “Can I have a copy of the data you’re using?” The
person I’m asking is less disrupted if they refuse to share.</p>
<p>A more constructive phrasing is “I need information on X to work on
Y, and I think you have information about X. How can you help me get
information on X?” By clarifying my intent, I allow the person with the
data to provide options I may not have considered.</p>
<p>Similarly, when I’m being asked for information, I try to learn the
person’s intent motivating the question. Sometimes the requester doesn’t
actually know what to ask for. Instead of “no” I try to figure out how
to enable the person to be successful.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude">Platitudes</a> are
<span data-acronym-label="thought terminating"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">thought terminating</span>; the
statement feels true and is resistant to debate. Platitudes capture a
feeling with sufficient accuracy, but with imprecise language. As a
result, there’s no specific action.</p>
<p>Because platitudes result in a conclusion, the conversation
participants may feel more bonded. However, that bond is shallow.</p>
<p>Example platitudes to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>pick your battles</p></li>
<li><p>Some things you can’t explain</p></li>
<li><p>Your time will come.</p></li>
<li><p>You can be anything that you want to be</p></li>
<li><p>I just want to get through this day</p></li>

<h4 id="tip-eliminate-speaking-over-other-people.">Tip: Eliminate
speaking over other people.<span id="sec:crosstalk"
label="sec:crosstalk"></span></h4>
<p>Crosstalk occurs two people who are communicating verbally experience
interference from another audible conversation. That can occur because a
third person is talking at one of the original two participants, or when
four or more people are holding two separate conversations
concurrently.</p>
<p>Crosstalk in a bureaucracy is motivated by limited time available to
communicate. A meeting participant may feel inspired by something
someone else said and want to interject. Crosstalk can indicate
engagement and enthusiasm, or it can be due to the speaker wanting to
dominate the topic through interruption. The likelihood of crosstalk is
dependent on the level of aggressiveness of participants. In either case
(enthusiasm or power-seeking), the original speakers are disrespected.
The original speaker may feel annoyed at being interrupted.</p>
<p>The audience is frustrated by the lack of clarity of where to focus.
This distraction causes participants to lose of focus and productivity
of the interaction decreases.</p>
<p>Bystander intervention for out-of-control meeting: raise your hand.
This non-verbally reverts focus back to the discussion facilitator.</p>
<h4 id="tip-account-for-warnocks-dilemma">Tip: Account for Warnock’s
dilemma</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warnock%27s_dilemma">Warnock’s
dilemma</a> is the common experience of figuring out how to interpret
not getting feedback. This is especially vital in meetings where the
speaker or facilitator needs to gauge participant comprehension of
delivered content. Simply asking “Does anyone not understand what I just
described?" is likely to get no response from attendees because
individuals want to avoid looking stupid.</p>
<p> <br />
<em>Technique</em>: Pick an individual to provide a recap.<br />
<em>Technique</em>: Survey the audience using multiple choice to gauge
understanding.</p>
<h4 id="tip-seek-action-with-a-deadline">Tip: Seek action with a
deadline</h4>
<p>When asking someone for help or input, specify a deadline for their
response. This helps the person prioritize their tasks.</p>
<h4 id="tip-ask-tell-ask">Tip: ask-tell-ask</h4>
<p>Collaborating with fellow bureaucrats who have expertise in areas you
do not requires extra work. There may be differences in the words used
to describe certain situations, more precision in wording that you’re
used to, or thinking about situations in ways you are not familiar with.
In that context, to bridge the differences you can ask, tell, ask<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The first step is asking what the other person’s perspective is on
the topic. This helps establish the appropriate level of nuance is and
can tell you how that person frames the issue. The second step is to
tell the person what you want to say. The “tell” step should leverage
what you learned from the first “ask” step. Use phrasing that is
consistent with what you just learned from the other person. The third
step is to ask the person what they heard from you. If they are unable
to tell you, you may need to refine your delivery. To improve the
likelihood of success keep the content in the second step short.</p>
<p>The ask-tell-ask technique can be used iteratively in the same
conversation, especially in discussion complex topics with a new
collaborator. Using ask-tell-ask takes long than just telling but
increases the effectiveness of the communication. You also get to learn
more about the other person’s perspective.</p>
<h4 id="tip-initial-responsiveness-and-status-updates">Tip: Initial
responsiveness and status updates</h4>
<p>In a bureaucracy requiring approval, or soliciting input, sometimes
waiting can provide value to the person doing the waiting. The request
may be overcome by events, or the person asking may remind which
indicates priority.</p>
<h4 id="tip-read-each-emailmemoreport-to-determine-the-purpose">Tip:
Read each email/memo/report to determine the purpose </h4>
<p><em>Problematic behavior</em>: scan the text, see if there is
immediate action or response needed. If no action or response is needed,
go to the next email.<br />
That does not work for emails that contain logistics associated with
future events.</p>
<p>Instead, consider possible intentions of the person writing the
email.</p>
<p><strong>Decision needed</strong>. Typically includes context.<br />
<em>Action</em>: if the team maintains a decision log in Confluence or
wiki, update that. Response is selection of a choice.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting logistics</strong>.<br />
<em>Action</em>: create or update a calendar event Response should
restate the logistics (time/date/location/purpose) to confirm</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorming</strong><br />
may provoke a response for building on an idea "For your situational
awareness, no action needed." Notification of activity by someone else.
Or change in plans. If needed, a correction to the described direction
might trigger a response or even a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong> e.g. describing a process or business
workflow. Or a citation.<br />
<em>Action</em>: Copy process documentation to Confluence or wiki. Copy
citation to bibliography Acknowledgement response thanking the sender
for the update/clarification</p>
<p><strong>Setting a formal policy or issuing an informal
edict</strong><br />
<em>Action</em>: move the policy/edict documentation to Confluence or
Wiki Acknowledgement response needed only if the edit is aimed at just
me or the group I am leading</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong><br />
If this is a recurring question, move to a “Frequently Asked Questions"
page on Confluence or Wiki Response needed that provides answer or seeks
clarification</p>
<p>Here I’m using “action" to refer to activities outside the email
channel.</p>
<p>If I read email to figure out the purpose of the email, that will
help me determine what action and response are relevant.</p>
<p>Whether I am the only recipient or on of many receivers can change
the intent of the email, and whether I’m in the “to" or “cc" field
matters. Unfortunately, “to" versus “cc" are not reliable indicators
since email senders do not reliably conform to the expected use.</p>
<p>This categorization of text within emails is a useful natural
language processing challenge for machine learning. Gmail already does
some of this with identifying meeting logistics, providing reminders to
follow-up, and providing reply snippets. A browser plug-in that
differentiates the various purposes of text could help readers determine
relevant actions and responses.</p>
<h4 id="tip-survey-stakeholders">Tip: Survey stakeholders</h4>
<p>Suppose you are a <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/">Peace
Corps</a> worker in Africa. You show up and the village doesn’t have
easy access to clean water. Villagers walk a long ways in dangerous
areas for dirty, unsafe water. This is a very obvious problem and all
the villagers agree that they don’t have good water and that this
problem should be fixed.</p>
<p>Implementing the solution would take about a week - get the equipment
to the village, drill a well, build a pump.</p>
<p>You could take additional time and involve the villagers in this
project. They could participate in getting the equipment, which should
lead to a sense of ownership. But then when the equipment shows up, they
don’t take action to drill the well. If the well is drilled, it soon
falls into disrepair and the villagers are back to doing things they way
they used to. What happened?</p>
<p>The villagers don’t see access to clean water as the most significant
issue. You came in and imposed your view of what the problem is and how
to fix it. When you impose your view of what the problem is, the
solution won’t be adopted by villagers because they don’t prioritize it.
It is better to survey the community to see how they operate. What do
they think the problems are? Both leadership and the community members
need to provide priorities.</p>
<p>This issue is exacerbated if you come to the village as a
representative of a company providing wells. You are biased when you
ask, “Do you have any problems?"</p>
<p>Of course the villagers have water problems which could be fixed with
better wells. However, when you get into the details of placing or
improving a well, they lose interest. What the community really wants is
free installation, zero maintenance, easy to use, and no operational
costs. That would improve their life.</p>
<p>When you say there’s cost (both initial investment of capital and
then operations/maintenance) and a learning curve associated with the
solution, then the user’s interest wanes – you are presenting another
cost/benefit ratio for them to evaluate. Then they ask "Can we get by
without the well?" Yes, they don’t need the well – they’ve survived
without it.</p>
<p>Novel solutions (in this example, drilling a well and installing a
pump) have have barriers to adoption. Two barriers are the current
priorities of the community and the incumbent solution/processes.</p>
<p>If there are problems with higher priority, the community will delay
implementing your solution. That’s fine if the higher-ranked priorities
are bounded, but they are often not. An example of this is the
following: Suppose a person has three tasks, and you introduce a
solution which is a fourth task. If the first task is “go from point A
to point B," then that task will eventually be eliminated and there will
be three remaining. If the second task is “secure your village," that is
an unbounded task. The person won’t get to or won’t prioritize your
low-ranked task.</p>
<p>How will your solution impact their higher-ranked priorities?</p>
<p> <br />
<strong>Summary of what action should be carried out</strong><br />
As the outsider, you should help the community enumerate and document
all of the problems they identify. Then you can help enumerate and
document how the problems are related (dependencies). Only then can you
help the community identify and document the root causes.</p>
<p>If the solution you, the outsider, identified really is the root
cause, then the community will arrive at that independently. If that is
the case, then you can enable them to implement a solution which
addresses the root causes. The community will then have a sense of
ownership.</p>
<h3 id="friction-between-teams-within-an-organization">Friction between
teams within an organization</h3>
<p>Ideally there is a clear division of responsibilities among teams.
Even in that context there is necessarily some interaction among teams –
one team may depend on the output from another team. Coordination among
the teams regarding transfer of data or products or projects or
knowledge is critical to the smooth operation of the organization.</p>
<p>An organization has finite staffing, money, time. Therefore, teams
within the organization face a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum</a>
distribution of resources.</p>
<p>Difference of decision making perspective based on local conditions,
stupidity, or different incentives, different definitions of success</p>
<p>When attempting to resolve friction between teams, there is an
authority common to the teams, but that person lacks the nuanced
insight, doesn’t have time to get involved in every challenge, and
doesn’t want to micromanage multiple teams.</p>
<p>Stakeholders care about the outcome of a decision. In some sense,
every participant in an organization is invested the outcome of every
decision made because there is consequence to how resources are
allocated and the direction of the organization. Every org member has an
opinion, even lacking experience or expertise.</p>
<h3 id="financial-models-of-communication">Financial models of
communication</h3>
<p>Late to a meeting is theft, and poorly written email and email to the
wrong people has financial cost.</p>
<h4 id="meeting-time-compared-to-theft">Meeting time compared to
theft</h4>
<p>In large organizations, there can be significant bureaucracy
associated with even small purchases. A multi-step review process may be
incurred for a $2000 acquisition.</p>
<p>Another measurement of value is that if an employee were to steal
even $200 worth of materials, the organization would likely punish that
employee.</p>
<p>In the book High Output Management <span class="citation"
data-cites="1995_Grove">(Grove 1995)</span>, Grove points out that those
metrics apply to tangible goods, but not to people’s time. Consider a
meeting of 10 people and each person’s cost is $200 per hour. A wasted
meeting is not unusual and certainly would not incur bureaucratic review
processes. The cost to the organization is fiscally the same – $2000.
Similarly, consider an employee who is late and causes a loss of
productivity. Merely depriving the organization of $200 worth of time is
not punished in the same way theft is.</p>
<p>In fact, organizations default to meetings (even recurring meetings)
rather than not meet. And being late to a meeting is accepted.</p>
<p>We can debate the differences between theft of materials and theft of
time. The financial argument is clear.</p>
<h4 id="email-is-not-free">Email is not free</h4>
<p>Total cost of email: * time spent writing * time spent reading *
infrastructure maintenance</p>
<p>Cost per email = (hourly rate of writer)*(time spent writing) +
(hourly rate of reader)*(time spent reading)*(number of readers)+(annual
salary of maintainer)/(number of emails per year) + (email server
cost)/(number of emails per year), etc</p>
<p>50*(5/60) + 50*(5/60)*4 + 100000/1000000 + 10000/1000000 = $21 for

<p>Characterizing meetings is critical to distinguishing which norms are
applicable, and what people expect from the different formats.</p>
<p>Types of meetings: internal meetings, customer meetings, conferences,
scheduled one-on-ones, impromptu walk-around.</p>
<p>Many potential purposes of a meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To gather input from attendees</p></li>
<li><p>To make a pronouncement to attendees</p></li>
<li><p>To educate</p></li>
<li><p>To brainstorm ideas</p></li>
<li><p>To make progress towards an objective</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the purpose is not explicitly stated, confusion arises. When
multiple purposes occur in one meeting and the transition is not
explicitly stated, confusion arises. The reason for this confusion is
that the assumptions and expectations and norms of each purpose are
different. When the attendees don’t know the purpose or the purpose
shifts, the expected behaviors and roles are unclear.</p>
<p>An attendee can ask what the purpose of the meeting is during the
meeting but that is generally considered rude. An attendee can try to
deduce the purpose of a meeting, but this takes time and attention and
can result in the wrong conclusion. An attendee can try to set the
purpose of the meeting during the meeting, but this can conflict with
the intent of other attendees.</p>
<p>A meeting’s purpose can shift during a meeting. If done
intentionally, the changes should be stated explicitly. Otherwise an
attendee may continue to operate under the previous set of expectations
rather than the current norms.</p>

<h2 id="bureaucratic-processes">Bureaucratic Processes<span
id="sec:process" label="sec:process"></span></h2>
<p>If you consider yourself inexperienced in thinking about bureaucratic
processes, then consider processes in terms of your own habits. You
might eat at the same time every day, or you might go to bed at the same
time. Those are both examples of personal policies. In the same way,
organizations seek routines.</p>
<p>My intent of think of bureaucratic processes for organizations as
being akin to a person’s habits is to make the concept relatable to your
experiences. Both are routines which ease the burden of decision making.
A habit can be intentional (my policy is to brush my teeth before going
to bed), just as a process can be designed. Habits can be unconscious
(arriving at work without recalling driving there), just as processes
can arise without design.</p>
<p>An intentional habit an individual has is motivated by a personal
policy. Bureaucrats acting on behalf of an organization apply processes
that support the policies of the organization.</p>
<h3 id="definition-of-process">Definition of Process</h3>
<p>A bureaucratic <span data-acronym-label="process"
data-acronym-form="singular+short">process</span> is a sequence of
tasks, with each task invoking policy enforcement by bureaucrats. The
policy of an organization is a decision about what action is required,
allowed, or not allowed.</p>
<p>A process has inputs and outputs. A process can be decomposed into
other processes. Processes operate on both information and tangible
objects. Processes require <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)">work</a> and time.
Processes are carried out by people or machines.</p>
<p>Dividing processes into separate tasks is associated with distinct
roles. The distinction of roles originates in skill specialization,
separation of responsibilities, and narrow authority. When there aren’t
sufficient staffing individual bureaucrats have multiple roles. This can
lead to a conflict of interest among the roles and is experienced by the
bureaucrat as a dissonance. For example, when one person has both the
responsibility to implement the plan and review the completed
implementation, the oversight is ineffective. <a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>Processes are important for organizations because they create a
defensible story for the bureaucrats involved – not the actual equitable
distribution.</p>
<p>That’s theoretical and generic, but there’s already some practical
relevance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The point to understanding concepts like process and policy is so

<li><p>In your role as a bureaucrat administering a process, check that
the person you are inflicting the process on can explain the steps back
to you. If they cannot, their confusion will likely create more work for
the bureaucrats.</p></li>
<li><p>As the subject of a process, check that your understanding of the
process is consistent with the bureaucrat’s intent. Summarize the next

</ul>
<p>The simplification and the neglect of specific circumstances results
in process friction. Process friction manifest in waste of resources
(tangible or expertise), temporal inefficiency, emotional frustration,
and social distrust of institutions.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-process">Types of Process</h3>
<p>The generic definition of process above obscures distinct
subcategories. In practice there are three types of processes: heroic,
bureaucratic, and social.</p>
<p>A <u>heroic process</u> is exemplified by a single person or a very
small number of people doing the work associated with a specific task.
The person may be acting in multiple roles and typically relies on
expertise from multiple domains. This approach is not sustainable as
there’s significant dependence on the hero(s). The heroic process is a
common pattern because it minimizes the work of other bureaucrats and is
more efficient because there’s less hand-off among bureaucrats. The
heroic process may cause demoralization of the hero and lead to
burn-out.</p>
<p>Processes with fewer people and fewer steps can be quicker and use
fewer resources, but they are more fragile and are less representative.
Having more people involved helps with edge cases, but slows down the
process. Hero culture is rarely an intentional design; it is based on
personalities and cost to the organization. Redundancy like having a
buddy system (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair
programming</a> for software, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1">RAID
1</a> for data storage) cost more in the short term.</p>
<p>The arguments against hero culture center on the long-term benefits
of resilience and scalability.</p>
<p>A <u>bureaucratic process</u> is a sequence of steps with each step
administered by a different bureaucrat. The steps of the process may not
be communicated to process participants, which often causes frustration
when the person has to discover each step sequentially. The number of
steps in the bureaucratic process may seem onerous to people going
through the process because of the multiple interactions with different
bureaucrats (compared to the heroic process). The process often takes
longer than desired due to loss of information and context in the
hand-off among bureaucrats. The participant has to re-explain the same
background to each bureaucrat.</p>
<p>In contrast to heroic processes and social processes, bureaucratic
processes are associated with the use of forms (paper or electronic).
Forms are meant to ensure consistent application of policy, and to catch
people who shouldn’t get the resource (both in cases of accidental
request and malicious request). For malicious requests, a more
burdensome process merely filters the low-cost grifters.</p>
<p>A <u>social process</u> is undocumented and relies on relationships
instead of hierarchy. There is a strong sensitivity to prior experiences
of the bureaucrats and on the skills of the people involved. There is no
single person that represents or manages the social network, so the
entry point is through relationships with bureaucrats who have existing
connections.</p>
<p>Once distinctions are recognized, tactics can be used to address the
challenges associated with each.</p>
<p>If you are blocked by the hero of a heroic process, you can try
waiting until the hero leaves. Given burn-out and turn-over, sometimes
this is only a few years. Alternatively, you can try creating a positive
relationship with the hero. If you’re the hero and don’t want to be,
look for ways to transition to bureaucratic or social processes.</p>
<p>For the social process, participants are swayed by reputation more
than title. Prestige and reputation matter. Doing favors for
participants helps.</p>
<p>Social processes can work well for small tasks that are infrequent.
Social processes can be effective in anomalous situations.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic processes are useful under typical conditions. When you
are forced to use a bureaucratic process, avoid starting with the most
important or hardest problem. Send a test dummy through the sequence of
steps. This enumerates the process, provides a measure of the time
needed to get through the process, and identify key personnel. In an
ideal bureaucratic process your reputation wouldn’t matter. That
assumption turns out to not be valid.</p>
<p>Thinking of bureaucratic processes in opposition to social
relationships is a false dichotomy. Bureaucratic processes are social
relationships formalized.</p>
<p>When no process exists, only people with relationships succeed.
Processes enable novices to an organization to contribute value and gain
experience.</p>
<p>Processes (whether heroic, bureaucratic, or social) are not
consistent because relationships vary – both among the bureaucrats
administering the process and the person going through the process.</p>

<p>Does a process exist?</p>
<p>Do participants know about existing processes?</p>
<p>Processes can be undocumented. Then oral folklore is the
mechanism.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-processes-exist">Why do processes exist?</h3>
<p>Bureaucratic organizations manage scarce shared resources (tangible
or expertise). Policies are decisions administered by bureaucrats.
Processes inform the decision making of bureaucrats and result in access
to shared resources.</p>
<p>The following sections provide more detailed explanation for by
organizations rely on processes. The reason this matters to you as a
bureaucrat is when you design a process or attempt to revise an existing
process, you should keep these aspects in mind. Similarly, as a person
going through a process, the reasoning below explains why you are
experiencing friction.</p>
<h4 id="processes-ensure-consistent-application-of-policy">Processes
Ensure Consistent Application of Policy</h4>
<p>Organizations are designed to be insensitive to individual
participants, both in terms of bureaucrats and subjects. Processes
attempt to address risk to the allocated resource and risk to the
bureaucrats carrying out the process.</p>
<p>The risk addressed by the use of processes is both in-the-moment bad
behavior and the potential of things going bad in the future. Process
act as guardrails to prevent harm to the bureaucrats and the shared
resource. An example guardrail is keep stakeholders informed
(justifications provided) so that intervention can be taken if
needed.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedy of
the Commons</a> says that when there is a shared resource, someone will
try to get away with behavior that is harmful to the organization.
Without oversight processes, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
commons</a> occurs and malicious actors dominate.</p>
<p>Create processes for oversight/review/approval Each process may be
justifiable, but the aggregate can feel unreasonably burdensome to
subjects and bureaucrats.</p>
<h4 id="processes-exist-to-simplify">Processes exist to Simplify</h4>
<p>Compared to an ad hoc approach, processes are intended to simplify
what could otherwise be complicated moral decisions, coordination
challenges, or financial assessments.</p>
<p>A positive view is that specialization allows narrow focus and thus
deeper understanding and skill. An alternative perspective is that
specialization allows for dumbing down the role, thus enabling a cheaper
workforce. In that view process allows dumb individuals to, as a group
accomplish complicated things. As a specific example, consider the
process of designing and building a car. That complexity is feasible to
undertake for a skilled and knowledgeable individual, but the cheaper
approach is to hire individuals capable of installing the passenger-side
doors in an assembly line.</p>
<p>Process development is driving by increased complexity.</p>
<h4 id="processes-enable-increased-throughput">Processes Enable
Increased Throughput</h4>
<p>Processes that leverage specialization can improve scalability. Adam
Smith’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process#Adam_Smith">pin
factory example</a> cites a productivity gain of 240x. Similarly, the
introduction of moving assembly lines in Ford’s car factory produced an
8x improvement of throughput.</p>
<p>While social processes may work well for low-volume ad-hoc requests,
formalized bureaucratic processes become necessary for recurring
high-volume activities.</p>
<h4 id="processes-decrease-reliance-on-social-relations">Processes
Decrease Reliance on Social Relations</h4>
<p>Relation between processes and social relations was identified by
Selznick in <span class="citation" data-cites="1943_Selznick">(Selznick
1943)</span>.</p>
<p>For a given complexity and given scale, there are people who are more
social and less social and therefore desire more or less process.</p>
<p>There are people who want process and documentation and are confused
as to how things are operating when those aren’t present</p>
<p>social influence does not have visibility/transparency In contrast,
processes are easier to understand and to track</p>
<p>social influence is not antithetical to processes. There’s always a
mixture of the two</p>
<h4 id="processes-help-new-people">Processes help new people</h4>
<p>New people are likely to arrive and ask what are the processes and
where is the documentation?</p>
<p>People have been on a team for a long time say don’t burden me with
processes I just need to get things done using the relationships with
the people I have.</p>
<p>In addition to not having formed a social network, there’s a second
reason new people seek processes.</p>
<p>Recently graduated people from school are used to the existence of
formal processes at high school or university level. Therefore when they
join a job, they expect a similar set of conditions for processes to
exist and follow</p>
<p>onboarding for processes is easy – folk lore or documentation</p>
<p>social onboarding: sitting with other teams (prisoner exchange) to
build network. Where you sit matters.</p>
<h4 id="processes-exist-as-artifacts-for-promotion">Processes exist as

<p>Processes can arise organically (bottom up) or be created
top-down</p>
<h3 id="riding-the-chaos">Riding the Chaos</h3>
<p>A bureaucratic organization is a complex and chaotic<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a>
environment. A natural response is to impose processes and hierarchy and
roles. Imposing structure can feel intellecually fulfilling and
emotionally satisfying. Imposing structure looks like progress and may
even help with your promotion in the hierarchy. The challenge (or
continual source of employment) is that chaos is dynamic. A process
created in response to chaos create new problems and is disrupted by
changes in number of staff, changes to who is part of the process,
changes to amount of work. The half-life of structure depends on the
rate of change of tasking and the rate of personnel turn-over (see §<a
href="#sec:turnover" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:turnover">[sec:turnover]</a>).</p>
<p>You could try to run away from the chaos, or you could try to ignore
it. Another option is to build skills for navigating the chaos of a
bureaucratic organization.</p>
<p>Build and maintain your network of connections with fellow
bureaucrats. This augments the chain of command of a hierarchy. There is
a turn-over in both hierarchical roles and in your professional network,
which means you need to continually invest effort in creating new bonds
and maintain existing relations.</p>
<p>See change as an opportunity for improvement rather than a
destruction of your previous investments. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">sunk cost fallacy</a>
applies to your emotional state and the resources you invested. Fear of
change is understandable – it disrupts the comfort of stability and
known processes. Anticipating change and preparing for it ease the
stress of change.</p>
<p>Leverage personalities and unique traits rather than expecting
everyone to be interchangable and treating differences as flaws. By
knowing the strengths, interests, and weaknesses of coworkers you can
facilitate the process of change.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions-to-a-process">Exceptions to a Process<span
id="sec:exceptions-to-process"
label="sec:exceptions-to-process"></span></h3>
<p>Process designers a usually motivated to address a specific issue.
When bureaucrats execute a process to support a policy, there may be
cases that violate the designer’s assumptions. Now the person with the
exceptional case and the bureaucrat carrying out the policy have extra
work to deal with the broken process. This is a source of bureaucratic
debt (see §<a href="#sec:bureaucratic_debt" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:bureaucratic_debt">[sec:bureaucratic_debt]</a> for
details).</p>
<p>When the routine process seem inadequate, there are routes for
exceptions: * correct the process to address the exceptional case *
ignore the process * ignore the task * seek an exception to the process,
recurring or one-time * social capital (title, reputation) * data driven
argument</p>
<p>The designer of a process may not be able to anticipate future
circumstances, but expecting the capacity to be responsive to change is
reasonable. The process designer should use sunset provisions and escape
hatches. A sunset provision can be time-based (this policy expires after
3 years) or based on a threshold (this policy expires after 1000 cases).
An escape hatch specifies the conditions under which the participants
are excepted from the policy.</p>

<p>Mistakes can originate from the bureaucrat, in the hand off, or from
the subject.</p>
<p>Imposing sanity checks meant to reduce mistakes create more

<p>As a process participant, I may cause a mistake or observe a mistake.

relays it to their maanger, who talks to the manager of the engineering
team, who delegates the responsibility tot he engineer. This is a
solvable problem, in that the engineer can talk with the customer.</p>

<h4 id="bureaucratic-inertia">Bureaucratic Inertia</h4>
<p>Creating an organization, staffing, funding, getting office space,
setting up communication technologies, and creating processes is a
significant investment of time and money and people. Changes to the size
of an organization (making it larger or smaller) to better reflect the
scope of task and the number of tasks has a lag. Changes to processes or
creating new processes displace how participants think of their roles,
or rely on new skills.</p>
<p>Seemingly simple tasks like buying pens incurs significant overhead
of work and time.</p>
<p>Another source is the over-subscription of tasks to amount of
attention available and resources available. The response to some tasks
is necessarily delayed or left unaddressed, impeding workflows that
depend on those outcomes.</p>
<h4 id="why-processes-change">Why Processes Change</h4>
<p>Any Nash equilibrium is constantly being upset by the change in
conditions and change in people (who have varying motives).</p>
<p>Processes change over time because the conditions change. Processes
are implemented differently than intended because the people
implementing them are not the same people who came up with and designed
them</p>
<h4 id="why-change-a-process">Why Change a Process</h4>
<p>Why change:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To make an improvement to an existing processes that are working

<li><p>improving an existing process by undoing mistakes previously
made</p></li>
<li><p>inventing a new process where there previously was not
one</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you recognize that processes are evolutionary, then the
appropriate response is to allow and look for for iterative change (fail
fast) rather than attempting to create static processes.</p>

<p>Top-down * benefit: unified vision –&gt; global optimization *

<p>1) humans use OODA loops 2) to change an organization, change the
OODA loops of participants 3) not all humans are equally important in an
organization. For that reason, surveys may be misleading. Organizations
typically have a few dominant participants – the mavens. These people
may or may not be leaders in the organization. 4) use a social
implementation of Page Rank to find the relevant participants. In a
one-on-one interaction, ask the person who they would recommend talking
to. “Who else would you recommend talking to about this topic?" is the
last question in the first conversation. To initiate this search
process, simply start with your first-order social connections. Cover
both low-level participants and the chain of command. Leverage the trust
already in the social network by starting conversations with “When I
spoke with Bob he recommended I talk to you about <span

<p>Incompetent people can innovate just as much as well-informed

disappointing, wasteful, or even harmful.</p>
<p>Design processes to prevent bad people from joining the process,
detect them when they are in the process, and remove them when they do
not change their behavior. Simultaneously, enable and detect good ideas
and promote them and give them resources. Promote efficiency, have
enough justification so that something goes wrong there’s a clear track
of why without burdening too much documentation.</p>
<p>When designing a process, look for ways to minimize the impact on the
people involved. Minimizing work (both physical and mental) for the
people involved means less sensitivity to entropy in a bureaucracy.
Minimizing work requires significant situational awareness on the part
of the designer. In order to minimize impact on existing bureaucracy,
it’s vital to minimize the requirements to achieve success.</p>

<h4 id="slowing-deployment-of-processes">Slowing Deployment of
Processes<span id="sec:slow_deployment"
label="sec:slow_deployment"></span></h4>
<p>Three tactics which inhibit deployment of changes within a
bureaucratic organization are stonewalling, slow rolling, and red
herrings.</p>
<p><u>Stonewalling</u> is when the recipient of a request or question
simply doesn’t reply. There are legitimate reasons for a lack of
response. The person may be busy and didn’t see your message, or they
did see your message but didn’t have a chance to reply yet because a
response to you is lower priority than other tasks they have. I’m unable
to differentiate those from when the recipient doesn’t want to enable me
to proceed. They may disagree with my objective and see silence as less
confrontational than explicit rejection.</p>
<p>One way of circumventing stonewalling is to ask if the respondent is
opposed to your idea. Then a lack of response indicates no opposition.
This tactic applies if you are confident the recipient will read or hear
the message.</p>
<p>An unintentional source of stonewalling is when you ask on the wrong
channel. Sending an email may result in what appears to be stonewalling
if the person relies on chat messages or the phone. The solution for
this is for the person who only uses certain channels to explicitly
indicate that. An automatic out-of-office email that says “Contact me by
phone” tells the sender the preferred channel.</p>
<p>If you need time to think or gather information before responding,
tell the person asking that you acknowledge their message and will
follow up in more detail later (with a specific timeline).</p>
<p><u>Slow rolling</u> is when you get a response to your request or
question, but the response isn’t helpful. There is a delay in the
outcome because you have to iterate to get an answer. There are valid
reasons for a slow roll and there are uncool reasons for a slow roll
response. Perhaps the person wants to acknowledge your request but
doesn’t currently have time to provide a full explanation. The person
may need to gather more information for the complete response. Or the
person may understand your question and does not want to enable your
progress.</p>
<p>The reason for a slow roll should be made explicit by the respondent,
and a timeline for a complete response is helpful.</p>
<p><u>Bikeshedding</u> is when the recipient of a question or request <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">focuses on
unimportant details relative to the primary topic</a>.</p>
<p>A <u>red herring</u> response is misleading, whether intentional or
not. The respondent provides what looks like a reasonable answer but
results in unproductive work. Occasionally there is a coincidental
benefit of discovering something unexpected, but that wasn’t the intent
of the respondent.</p>
<h3 id="processes-involving-two-organizations">Processes involving two
Organizations</h3>
<p>When two independently-governed processes interact, there can be
friction. Process friction, especially two uncoordinated organizations,
results in either exceptions to the process (§<a
href="#sec:exceptions-to-process" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:exceptions-to-process">[sec:exceptions-to-process]</a>)
or lying or change in process (§<a href="#sec:change_a_process"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:change_a_process">[sec:change_a_process]</a>).
Example: receipts from one process submitted for reimbursement to
another process. Submitting the receipt shifts the accountability and
justification burden to the accepting bureaucrat.</p>
<p>I have dental insurance. I visited the dentist December 2 and one of
the procedures during a routine cleaning was “bitewing x-rays." This
procedure is covered by my insurance, so I was surprised when I received
a bill for it from my dentist.</p>
<p>I called my dentist and they explained that the dental insurance had
declined to pay for the procedure. I called the insurance company Jan 3
and they confirmed that the procedure was covered by my policy. Every
time I call the insurance provider I have to provide my SSN, DoB, and
Zip twice – once to the automated system, a second time to the person I
talk with. The insurance company apparently had made a mistake and said
they would cover the cost of the procedure. I followed up with my
dentist and explained the situation.</p>
<p>I called the dentist to see if they had received payment yet. They
had not, so I called the dental insurance provider again Feb 6 and 8.
Feb 8 the insurance company said they would process the payment within
7-10 business days. I called again Feb 20 and the claim hadn’t been
initiated within the insurance company. I spoke to the supervisor and
she said she would personally visit the claims office within the
insurance company.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the dentist, they are seeking money for the
service they provided me.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the insurance company, delaying payment on a
claim makes good financial sense – the policy holder is likely to just
pay the balance in order to avoid going to court with the dentist.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the question is whether chasing this issue makes
financial sense. I think of my hourly rate as <span
class="math inline">40, <em>s</em><em>o</em><em>a</em><em>f</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>r</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>g</em><em>e</em><em>o</em><em>f</em></span>38
would have been better to pay out of pocket. Effectively I’m devaluing
my time. The emotional stress and thought-cycles expended are also
relevant, though harder to quantify.</p>
<h3 id="tactic-approval-forgiveness-opposition">Tactic: Approval,
Forgiveness, Opposition</h3>
<p>A common bureaucratic task is consensus regarding action or expending
resources. There are distinct options about how to get that
consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seek approval before taking action. This approach incurs both
providing justification and waiting.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask forgiveness after taking action. Often viewed as being in
contrast to seeking approval. Less delay, and usually works if things go
well or if no one notices.</p></li>
<li><p>Notification of Intent with deadline for response. The window for
response should be sufficient to actually allow feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Solicit opposition before taking action. This is a different
framing from approval or forgiveness. It decreases the risk the approver
has to take on.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to proceed depends on the personalities of the people
involved in building consensus and their relationships.</p>
<p>Most organization default to an approval-based processes. Each new
idea needs to be signed off as approved by a sequential list of
bureaucrats. The sequence (not concurrent) process may be known in
advance, or it may be ad hoc if the request is novel.</p>
<p>Relying on approval is harmful to innovation because sign-off by each
bureaucrat is interpeted as “I am 100% in agreement with this.” Each
stakeholder has to bless innovation and tie their reputation to the
outcome.</p>
<p>The “I won’t stop this” (soliciting opposition) is a more useful
paradigm. With the consensus process language changed to "I won’t stop
this," then the bureaucrat can avoid taking responsibility for the idea
and therefore are not tying their reputation to the result.</p>
<h3 id="static-and-dynamic-process">Static and Dynamic Process<span
id="sec:static-dynamic_processes"
label="sec:static-dynamic_processes"></span></h3>
<p>Change within an organization is to be expected since the external
environment the organization exists in is not static. With that premise,
why are static processes that are not robust to change created in the
first place? Answer: so policy creators can point to an effort and avoid
looking neglectful.</p>
<p>Creating robust processes that are dynamic takes more investment.
First, the underlying process must be documented. What is expected to
happen? Who are the stakeholders? This logic is what is fragile to
change. Second, document assumptions used in the process. If the
assumptions are invalidated, then the process is broken and needs to be
discarded or at least revised.</p>
<p>The problem is that even when the process is documented and
assumptions enumerated, they may not be checked to see if revision is
necessary. Measurements need to be periodically taken to see if the
assumptions are still applicable. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision">Sunset
provisions</a> have a similar intent of forcing renewal.</p>
<p>A more quantitative approach is to tie a process to a cost/benefit
model. The benefit to implementing a process comes at some cost. If the
assumptions of the process can be tied to a cost/benefit model, then we
can determine whether the process is worth implementing. Periodic
measurements are needed to update the cost/benefit model and determine
whether the process is effective.</p>

data-acronym-form="singular+short">bureaucratic debt</span> is the cost
of the work needed to change a process<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>.
The bureaucratic debt is caused by choosing an easy solution now (with
limited information or insufficient resources) instead of using an
approach that would take longer to design and implement.</p>
<p>Decisions occur in a resource constrained environment. Getting
information (measurement) and analysis are costly in terms of money,
time, skill, and labor. Each decision made results in options that are
not explored. These missed opportunities are associated with short-term
versus long-term trade-offs of costs.</p>
<p>The opportunity costs (options the organization doesn’t take) alters
which future decisions become available.</p>
<p>The purpose of defining this concept is to capture the work resulting
from decisions that would otherwise be unaccounted for. Once the concept
of bureaucratic debt is understood it can be tracked.</p>
<p>To document bureaucratic debt, we need to capture decisions as they
are made:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the decision to be made?</p></li>
<li><p>When the decision was identified?</p></li>
<li><p>When the decision was made?</p></li>
<li><p>Who made the decision?</p></li>
<li><p>What options were identified?</p></li>
<li><p>Which option was chosen?</p></li>
<li><p>Why was that option was chosen over the other options?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of documenting decisions is to enable both aversion to
bad decisions and attraction to good decisions. Without documenting
decisions, there is no transparency, accountability, or historical
ability to track dependencies.</p>
<p>The documentation of decisions needs to be disseminated to
stakeholders. This should occur as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>For bureaucrats there are the processes and policies which get
applied to customers, the documentation of what those processes and
policies are, and guidance on when the processes and policies should be
applied.</p>
<p>The scale of decision impact determines the level of documentation.
"Do I choose pencil or pen?" incurs negligible bureaucratic debt;
therefore the documentation needed is also negligible. Projecting impact
of decisions is a subjective prediction.</p>
<h3 id="design-processes-for-turnover-of-staff">Design processes for
Turnover of Staff<span id="sec:turnover"
label="sec:turnover"></span></h3>
<p>When designing a process, there are a few goals to optimize for:
time-to-first-result, average latency, initial financial cost, total
financial cost, flexibility to input conditions, scalability. In a
theoretical view all these factors should inform decision making. An
often neglected aspect which is harder to quantify and thus harder to
model is the importance of employee turnover. On a long time scale
turnover of bureaucrats is a significant source of risk for any team or
project.</p>
<p>Designing processes often relies on treating participants as
interchangeable with other people who have similar skills. Accounting
for differences in enthusiasm or communication is difficult.</p>
<p>Making processes resilient to change requires educated bureaucrats.
That education occurs during on-boarding of the bureaucrat, during the
process, and as bureaucrats exit participation in the process.</p>
<p>On-boarding of new bureaucrats involves technical training,
explanation of norms, learning the processes, and creating a
professional network of coworkers. During this on-boarding the new
bureaucrat should be documenting their observations. Postponing the
creation of documentation until the new person has experience results in
a skewed and incomplete capture of the challenges.</p>
<p>Trained and experienced bureaucrats executing a process are
responsible for coordinating with other bureaucrats. Bureucrats should
be cross-trained in other roles to gain familiarity with other parts of
a process.</p>
<p>Bureaucrats exiting the team or organization or changing roles have a
responsibility to document their knowledge for team members. An exit
interview can inform how the team improves.</p>
<p>In each phase documentation is the mechanism for spreading knowledge.
Documenting the why (in addition to the how) is critical for the reader.
Access to documentation should be measured to determine whether there is
value to the investment.</p>
<h1 id="last-chapter">Last chapter</h1>
<p>You could operate within a bureaucracy and entirely focus on “just do
the job.” You can be more effective in your job by understanding the
role of engaging with other people – peer bureaucrats, supervisors, and
subjects.</p>
<p>Learning bureaucracy as a skill doesn’t mean you can ignore
personalities of individuals. Bureaucracy as a skill is in addition to
being a good person, being an effective member of a team, being a good
project manager, having technical skills, etc. The distinction from
those aspects is that a bureaucrat understands the complications and
constraints of their environment and then can more effectively operate
within those conditions.</p>
<h2 id="skills-of-an-effective-bureaucrat">Skills of an effective
bureaucrat</h2>
<p>The narrow scope of your role (which hopefully leverages your
education/training) does not capture all relevant aspects of your
job.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are able to facilitate meetings. This means agenda, providing
rules on interaction (raising hands), taking notes, and
follow-up.</p></li>
<li><p>You participate in meetings, whether that means actively
contributing or intentionally supporting other attendees. You leverage
relationships with other attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>You have focused educational efforts on written communication
(emails, text-based chats, reports). Your writing empathizes with
readers, captures relevant context, is concise, and is clearly
worded.</p></li>
<li><p>In your role as bureaucrat you leverage project management
skills: you have a vision, you make and share plans, all while building
consensus with stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>You have learned negotiation skills <span class="citation"
data-cites="1982_Cohen">(Cohen 1982)</span> that improve your
interactions and outcomes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The attitude of the effective bureaucrat is that of realistic
optimism. A realistic optimist will occasionally be wrong but makes
progress, whereas a pessimist will be right (because the prediction is
self-fulfilling) but not make progress.</p>

<p>An view from inside bureaucracy as a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_theory_and_organizations">complex
adaptive system</a>.</p>
<p>Central claims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everyone in modern society participates in bureaucracy. Therefore
becoming skilled is useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals already have experience with bureaucracy from
conventional roles in modern society.</p></li>
<li><p>Emergent behavior and being a wicked problem make the complexity
of bureaucracy irreducible to a simplistic model.</p></li>
<li><p>Bureaucracy occurs when there is</p>
<ul>
<li><p>sufficient scale because it is an emergent phenomenon for
distributed knowledge and distributed decision making; and</p></li>
<li><p>lack of common quantitative feedback mechanism for
individuals.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The techniques of bureaucracy are what lead to emergence at
scale: meetings, processes, communication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The consequence of thinking like a bureaucrat is that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>effects of bureaucracy are not the fault of one person, but each
person can improve bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p>you are not limited to only the direct personal interactions that
you have with other people. Framing allows you to think about processes
that exceed your direct visibility and experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Help you recognize options beyond the naive defaults associated
with fallacies (<a href="#sec:fallacies" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:fallacies">[sec:fallacies]</a>). What’s feasible?
What’s negotiable? Once you realize rules and processes are subjectively
created and enforced, negotiation (and identifying who to negotiate
with) is more obvious.</p></li>
<li><p>Decrease surprise when thing is not the way you naively expect.
Name dilemmas/trilemmas (<a href="#sec:dilemma_trilemma"

<h2 id="audience-analysis">Audience Analysis</h2>
<p>Primary audience for this book is self-identified novice bureaucrats
and people planning to work in a bureaucracy. Value of this book is
advice beyond “be a good person” and specific to the role of a
bureaucrat (and not project manager/team lead/software developer).</p>
<p>Secondary audience is white collar workers who have experience
working in a bureaucracy and are just realizing they are bureaucrats.
This audience will find some of the information to be already known. The
value for this audience is a re-framing of the environment and
problems.</p>
<p>Tertiary audience is non-bureaucrats who want to better understand
why bureaucratic systems are challenging. Americans consider themselves
"individuals" and neglect the necessary integration of operating within
a society. This book won’t be a popular best seller, but it is intended
for a lay audience and does not assume prior academic exposure to the
topic.</p>
<p>Lastly, researchers of bureaucracy. This book is not a theoretical
systemic analysis.</p>

<h2 id="new-team">New Team</h2>
<p>Prior to leaving the team you’re on, you can reflect on your current
position:</p>

tasks, responsibilities, or people that I will miss? If yes, can I
change my current role to have more of what I like?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can negotiate with your management and coworkers to address your
needs. Sometimes other people are not aware of what you want.</p>
<p>Once you are interviewing for a position you should be considering
the interactions as a chance to learn more about the the work and the
people. When interviewing for a new position, ask the following
questions<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is the team growing or is the focus shifting?<br />
(Teams hire to replace or grow. If replacing, why did the person leave?
If growing, is it an increase in capacity or expansion of scope or
change of focus?)</p></li>
