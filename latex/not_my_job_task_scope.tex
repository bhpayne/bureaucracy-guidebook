\subsection{Not my job: task scope}

% https://graphthinking.blogspot.com/2021/05/not-my-job-task-scope-and-collaboration.html

If I ask someone for help on a task that benefits the team, that person might respond that the task is ``not my job" and time spent on tasks like that ``gets in the way" of their progress. The interesting (emotionally rewarding) work is not that task.

The potential reasons for this reluctance to help include
\begin{itemize}
    \item will not get them promoted
    \item scope of their job and their expertise does not include the task
    \item they don't know how to do the task and they don't want to learn
\end{itemize}
In any case, the individual's ``progress" is not aligned with the success of the team.
