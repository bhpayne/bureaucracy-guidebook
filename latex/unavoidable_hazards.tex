\section{Unavoidable Hazards of Bureaucracy\label{sec:unavoidable_hazards}}

\textbf{Bureaucracy is inefficient}
Different participants have different motives, and the aggregation needed for coordination is inefficient.

Another example: Inefficiency of changing the requirements on a project partway through. If an objective quantitative measure were available, the ROI could be determined.

\textbf{Scope creep}

The customer wants more, and the exploration of what's possible is exciting (a positive experience).

The creator hears more work. This implies a few trade-off options, all of which are negative for one or both parties.
\begin{itemize}
    \item sticking with the original terms (telling the customer "no", which is negative for both parties)
    \item re-negotiation for additional compensation (a burden to both parties)
    \item the programmer doing more for the same pay, which means less money per effort (yielding a less happy programmer)
    \item decreasing existing efforts to fit the additional new requirements (yielding a less happy customer)
    \item even if the programmer is getting paid by the hour, additional work means the end product will be delayed to accommodate additional features (yielding a less happy customer)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Migrating technologies}

the person implementing the transition has to be educated in both the old and new technology. 
the legacy code has to be migrated to the new implementation
convincing stakeholders; may require synchronization
difficulty scales with the number of stakeholders
