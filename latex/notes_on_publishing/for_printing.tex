Blue type: Could be a problem if this is ever a 1-color (black) print book. Other colors should translate ok to a shade of black, but blue to black can be a problem (too faint).

Intentionally blank left-hand pages donâ€™t need running heads. This is probably a manual fix. If you ever go to print, let the printer know where the blanks fall.
