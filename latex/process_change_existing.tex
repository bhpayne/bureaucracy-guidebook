% process change
Any Nash equilibrium is constantly being upset by the change in conditions and change in people (who have varying motives).


Processes change over time because the conditions change. Processes are implemented differently than intended because the people implementing them are not the same people who came up with and designed them


Changing complex processes is hard because individuals involved in the process may depend on steps that are not visible to other people.
Processes do not exist in isolation
