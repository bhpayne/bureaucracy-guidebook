When designing a process, there are a few goals to optimize for: time-to-first-result, average latency, initial financial cost, total financial cost, flexibility to input conditions, throughput, scalability. In a theoretical sense all these factors should inform decision making. An often neglected aspect which is harder to predict and harder to measure is the importance of employee turnover. On a long time, scale turnover of bureaucrats is a significant source of risk for any team or project. 

Designing processes relies on roles: participants are treated as interchangeable with other people who have similar skills. Accounting for differences in enthusiasm or communication is difficult. 
Designing processes that are robust to turn over does not mean ignoring the unique talents of participants. 
Emphasize documentation (how and why) and training of new participants. 

Making processes resilient to change requires educated bureaucrats. That education occurs during on-boarding of the bureaucrat, during the process, and as bureaucrats exit participation in the process. 

On-boarding of new bureaucrats involves technical training, explanation of norms, learning the processes, and creating a professional network of coworkers. During this on-boarding the new bureaucrat should be documenting their observations. Postponing the creation of documentation until the new person has experience results in a skewed and incomplete capture of the challenges.

Trained and experienced bureaucrats executing a process are responsible for coordinating with other bureaucrats. Bureaucrats should be cross-trained in other roles to gain familiarity with other parts of a process. 

Bureaucrats exiting the team or organization or changing roles have a responsibility to document their knowledge for team members. An exit interview can inform how the team improves. 

In each phase documentation is the mechanism for spreading knowledge. Documenting the why (in addition to the how) is critical for the reader. Access to documentation should be measured to determine whether there is value to the investment.
