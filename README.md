The guidebook for Bureaucracy: <https://bhpayne.github.io/bureaucracy-guidebook>



This book is not "7 types of Bureaucrats You'll Encounter" or even "5 Tips on how to be a Better Bureaucrat."

I'm not able to consolidate the content down to a standard (concise) essay format, e.g., <https://www.bucks.edu/media/bcccmedialibrary/pdf/FiveParagraphEssayOutlineJuly08_000.pdf>


I assume the distribution format is PDF, or something else that supports hyperlinks.
